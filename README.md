# BOOKS

His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada's original books, pre-1978.

Formatted in DokuWiki syntax which closely resembles Creole, a universal wiki syntax specification.

The purpose of this repository is to create print-quality files of the digital books, that can be used in a range of applications. We also want to open up for translating the original books and/or collect translations that already exist.

**Some of the services that remain for this repository:**

  * Add Devanagari to Canto 5-10 (1-4 is done)
  * Add Bengali script for Caitanya-caritamrita
  * Verify against other sources, see difference
