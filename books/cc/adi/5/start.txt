====== The Glories of Lord Nityānanda Balarāma ======

This chapter is chiefly devoted to describing the essential nature and glories of Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu. Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the absolute Personality of Godhead, and His first expansion in a form for pastimes is Śrī Balarāma.

Beyond the limitation of this material world is the spiritual sky, //paravyoma,// which has many spiritual planets, the supreme of which is called Kṛṣṇaloka. Kṛṣṇaloka, the abode of Kṛṣṇa, has three divisions, which are known as Dvārakā, Mathurā and Gokula. In that abode the Personality of Godhead expands Himself into four plenary portions-Kṛṣṇa, Balarāma, Pradyumna (the transcendental Cupid) and Aniruddha. They are known as the original quadruple forms.

In Kṛṣṇaloka is a transcendental place known as Śvetadvīpa or Vṛndāvana. Below Kṛṣṇaloka in the spiritual sky are the Vaikuṇṭha planets. On each Vaikuṇṭha planet a four-handed Nārāyaṇa, expanded from the first quadruple manifestation, is present. The Personality of Godhead known as Śrī Balarāma in Kṛṣṇaloka is the original Saṅkarṣaṇa (attracting Deity), and from this Saṅkarṣaṇa expands another Saṅkarṣaṇa, called Mahā-saṅkarṣaṇa, who resides in one of the Vaikuṇṭha planets. By His internal potency, Mahā-saṅkarṣaṇa maintains the transcendental existence of all the planets in the spiritual sky, where all the living beings are eternally liberated souls. The influence of the material energy is conspicuous there by its absence. On those planets the second quadruple manifestation is present.

Outside of the Vaikuṇṭha planets is the impersonal manifestation of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, which is known as the Brahmaloka. On the other side of the Brahmaloka is the spiritual //kāraṇa-samudra,// or Causal Ocean. The material energy exists on the other side of the Causal Ocean, without touching it. In the Causal Ocean is Mahā-Viṣṇu, the original //puruṣa// expansion from Saṅkarṣaṇa. This Mahā-Viṣṇu places His glance over the material energy, and by a reflection of His transcendental body He amalgamates Himself within the material elements.

As the source of the material elements, the material energy is known as //pradhāna,// and as the source of the manifestations of the material energy it is known as //māyā.// But material nature is inert in that she has no independent power to do anything. She is empowered to make the cosmic manifestation by the glance of Mahā-Viṣṇu. Therefore the material energy is not the original cause of the material manifestation. Rather, the transcendental glance of Mahā-Viṣṇu over material nature produces that cosmic manifestation.

Mahā-Viṣṇu again enters every universe as the reservoir of all living entities, Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu. From Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu expands Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, the Supersoul of every living entity. Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu also has His own Vaikuṇṭha planet in every universe, where He lives as the Supersoul or supreme controller of the universe. Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu reclines in the midst of the watery portion of the universe and generates the first living creature of the universe, Brahmā. The imaginary universal form is a partial manifestation of Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu.

In the Vaikuṇṭha planet in every universe is an ocean of milk, and within that ocean is an island called Śvetadvīpa, where Lord Viṣṇu lives. Therefore this chapter describes two Śvetadvīpas-one in the abode of Kṛṣṇa and the other in the ocean of milk in every universe. The Śvetadvīpa in the abode of Kṛṣṇa is identical with Vṛndāvana-dhāma, which is the place where Kṛṣṇa appears Himself to display His loving pastimes. In the Śvetadvīpa within every universe is a Śeṣa form of Godhead who serves Viṣṇu by assuming the form of His umbrella, slippers, couch, pillows, garments, residence, sacred thread, throne and so on.

Lord Baladeva in Kṛṣṇaloka is Nityānanda Prabhu. Therefore Nityānanda Prabhu is the original Saṅkarṣaṇa, and Mahā-saṅkarṣaṇa and His expansions as the //puruṣas// in the universes are plenary expansions of Nityānanda Prabhu.

In this chapter the author has described the history of his leaving home for a personal pilgrimage to Vṛndāvana and his achieving all success there. In this description it is revealed that the author's original paternal home and birthplace were in the district of Katwa, in the village of Jhāmaṭapura, which is near Naihāṭī. Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja's brother invited Śrī Mīnaketana Rāmadāsa, a great devotee of Lord Nityānanda, to his home, but a priest named Guṇārṇava Miśra did not receive him well, and Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī's brother, not recognizing the glories of Lord Nityānanda, also took sides with the priest. Therefore Rāmadāsa became sorry, broke his flute and went away. This was a great disaster for the brother of Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī. But on that very night Lord Nityānanda Prabhu Himself graced Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī in a dream and ordered him to leave on the next day for Vṛndāvana.

  : Let me offer my obeisances to Lord Śrī Nityānanda, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose opulence is wonderful and unlimited. By His will, even a fool can understand His identity.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:2|Cc. Ādi 5.2]]
  : All glories to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. All glories to Lord Nityānanda. All glories to Advaita Ācārya. And all glories to all the devotees of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:3|Cc. Ādi 5.3]]
  : I have described the glory of Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya in six verses. Now, in five verses, I shall describe the glory of Lord Nityānanda.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:4|Cc. Ādi 5.4]]
  : The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, is the fountainhead of all incarnations. Lord Balarāma is His second body.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:5|Cc. Ādi 5.5]]
  : They are both one and the same identity. They differ only in form. He is the first bodily expansion of Kṛṣṇa, and He assists in Lord Kṛṣṇa's transcendental pastimes.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:6|Cc. Ādi 5.6]]
  : That original Lord Kṛṣṇa appeared in Navadvīpa as Lord Caitanya, and Balarāma appeared with Him as Lord Nityānanda.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:7|Cc. Ādi 5.7]]
  : May Śrī Nityānanda Rāma be the object of my constant remembrance. Saṅkarṣaṇa, Śeṣa Nāga and the Viṣṇus who lie on the Kāraṇa Ocean, Garbha Ocean and ocean of milk are His plenary portions and the portions of His plenary portions.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:8|Cc. Ādi 5.8]]
  : Lord Balarāma is the original Saṅkarṣaṇa. He assumes five other forms to serve Lord Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:9|Cc. Ādi 5.9]]
  : He Himself helps in the pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa, and He does the work of creation in four other forms.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:10|Cc. Ādi 5.10]]
  : He executes the orders of Lord Kṛṣṇa in the work of creation, and in the form of Lord Śeṣa He serves Kṛṣṇa in various ways.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:11|Cc. Ādi 5.11]]
  : In all the forms He tastes the transcendental bliss of serving Kṛṣṇa. That same Balarāma is Lord Nityānanda, the companion of Lord Gaurasundara.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:12|Cc. Ādi 5.12]]
  : I have explained this seventh verse in four subsequent verses. By these verses all the world can know the truth about Lord Nityānanda.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:13|Cc. Ādi 5.13]]
  : I surrender unto the lotus feet of Śrī Nityānanda Rāma, who is known as Saṅkarṣaṇa in the midst of the catur-vyūha [consisting of Vāsudeva, Saṅkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha]. He possesses full opulences and resides in Vaikuṇṭhaloka, far beyond the material creation.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:14|Cc. Ādi 5.14]]
  : Beyond the material nature lies the realm known as paravyoma, the spiritual sky. Like Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself, it possesses all transcendental attributes, such as the six opulences.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:15|Cc. Ādi 5.15]]
  : That Vaikuṇṭha region is all-pervading, infinite and supreme. It is the residence of Lord Kṛṣṇa and His incarnations.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:16|Cc. Ādi 5.16]]
  : In the highest region of that spiritual sky is the spiritual planet called Kṛṣṇaloka. It has three divisions-Dvārakā, Mathurā and Gokula.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:17|Cc. Ādi 5.17]]
  : Śrī Gokula, the highest of all, is also called Vraja, Goloka, Śvetadvīpa and Vṛndāvana.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:18|Cc. Ādi 5.18]]
  : Like the transcendental body of Lord Kṛṣṇa, Gokula is all-pervading, infinite and supreme. It expands both above and below, without any restriction.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:19|Cc. Ādi 5.19]]
  : That abode is manifested within the material world by the will of Lord Kṛṣṇa. It is identical to that original Gokula; they are not two different bodies.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:20|Cc. Ādi 5.20]]
  : The land there is touchstone [cintāmaṇi], and the forests abound with desire trees. Material eyes see it as an ordinary place.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:21|Cc. Ādi 5.21]]
  : But with the eyes of love of Godhead one can see its real identity as the place where Lord Kṛṣṇa performs His pastimes with the cowherd boys and cowherd girls.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:22|Cc. Ādi 5.22]]
  : "I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, the first progenitor, who is tending cows yielding all desires in abodes built with spiritual gems and surrounded by millions of purpose trees. He is always served with great reverence and affection by hundreds and thousands of goddesses of fortune."

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:23|Cc. Ādi 5.23]]
  : He manifests His own, form in Mathurā and Dvārakā. He enjoys pastimes in various ways by expanding into the quadruple forms.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:24|Cc. Ādi 5.24]]
  : Vāsudeva, Saṅkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha are the primary quadruple forms from whom all other quadruple forms are manifested. They are all purely transcendental.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:25|Cc. Ādi 5.25]]
  : Only in these three places [Dvārakā, Mathurā and Gokula] does the all-sporting Lord Kṛṣṇa perform His endless pastimes with His personal associates.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:26|Cc. Ādi 5.26]]
  : In the Vaikuṇṭha planets of the spiritual sky the Lord manifests His identity as Nārāyaṇa and performs pastimes in various ways.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:27-28|Cc. Ādi 5.27-28]]
  : Kṛṣṇa's own form has only two hands, but in the form of Lord Nārāyaṇa He has four hands. Lord Nārāyaṇa holds a conchshell, disc, club and lotus flower, and He is full of great opulence. The śrī, bhū and nīlā energies serve at His lotus feet.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:29|Cc. Ādi 5.29]]
  : Although His pastimes are His only characteristic functions, by His causeless mercy He performs one activity for the fallen souls.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:30|Cc. Ādi 5.30]]
  : He delivers the fallen living entities by offering them the four kinds of liberation-sālokya, sāmīpya, sārṣṭi and sārūpya.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:31|Cc. Ādi 5.31]]
  : Those who attain brahma-sāyujya liberation cannot gain entrance into Vaikuṇṭha; their residence is outside the Vaikuṇṭha planets.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:32|Cc. Ādi 5.32]]
  : Outside the Vaikuṇṭha planets is the atmosphere of the glowing effulgence, which consists of the supremely bright rays of the body of Lord Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:33|Cc. Ādi 5.33]]
  : That region is called Siddhaloka, and it is beyond the material nature. Its essence is spiritual, but it does not have spiritual varieties.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:34|Cc. Ādi 5.34]]
  : It is like the homogeneous effulgence around the sun. But inside the sun are the chariots, horses and other opulences of the sun-god.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:35|Cc. Ādi 5.35]]
  : "As through devotion to the Lord one can attain His abode, many have attained that goal by abandoning their sinful activities and absorbing their minds in the Lord through lust, envy, fear or affection."

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:36|Cc. Ādi 5.36]]
  : "Where it has been stated that the Lord's enemies and devotees attain the same destination, this refers to the ultimate oneness of Brahman and Lord Kṛṣṇa. This may be understood by the example of the sun and the sunshine, in which Brahman is like the sunshine and Kṛṣṇa Himself is like the sun."

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:37|Cc. Ādi 5.37]]
  : Thus in the spiritual sky there are varieties of pastimes within the spiritual energy. Outside the Vaikuṇṭha planets appears the impersonal reflection of light.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:38|Cc. Ādi 5.38]]
  : That impersonal Brahman effulgence consists only of the effulgent rays of the Lord. Those fit for sāyujya liberation merge into that effulgence.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:39|Cc. Ādi 5.39]]
  : "Beyond the region of ignorance [the material cosmic manifestation] lies the realm of Siddhaloka. The Siddhas reside there, absorbed in the bliss of Brahman. Demons killed by the Lord also attain that realm."

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:40|Cc. Ādi 5.40]]
  : In that spiritual sky, on the four sides of Nārāyaṇa, are the second expansions of the quadruple expansions of Dvārakā.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:41|Cc. Ādi 5.41]]
  : Vāsudeva, Saṅkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha constitute this second quadruple. They are purely transcendental.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:42|Cc. Ādi 5.42]]
  : There the personal feature of Balarāma called Mahā-saṅkarṣaṇa is the shelter of the spiritual energy. He is the primary cause, the cause of all causes.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:43|Cc. Ādi 5.43]]
  : One variety of the pastimes of the spiritual energy is described as pure goodness [viśuddha-sattva]. It comprises all the abodes of Vaikuṇṭha.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:44|Cc. Ādi 5.44]]
  : The six attributes are all spiritual. Know for certain that they are all manifestations of the opulence of Saṅkarṣaṇa.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:45|Cc. Ādi 5.45]]
  : There is one marginal potency, known as the jīva. Mahā-saṅkarṣaṇa is the shelter of all jīvas.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:46|Cc. Ādi 5.46]]
  : Saṅkarṣaṇa is the original shelter of the puruṣa, from whom this world is created and in whom it is dissolved.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:47|Cc. Ādi 5.47]]
  : He [Saṅkarṣaṇa] is the shelter of everything. He is wonderful in every respect, and His opulences are infinite. Even Ananta cannot describe His glory.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:48|Cc. Ādi 5.48]]
  : That Saṅkarṣaṇa, who is transcendental pure goodness, is a partial expansion of Nityānanda Balarāma.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:49|Cc. Ādi 5.49]]
  : I have briefly explained the eighth verse. Now please listen with attention as I explain the ninth verse.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:50|Cc. Ādi 5.50]]
  : I offer my full obeisances unto the feet of Śrī Nityānanda Rāma, whose partial representation called Kāraṇodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, lying on the Kāraṇa Ocean, is the original puruṣa, the master of the illusory energy, and the shelter of all the universes.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:51|Cc. Ādi 5.51]]
  : Outside the Vaikuṇṭha planets is the impersonal Brahman effulgence, and beyond that effulgence is the Kāraṇa Ocean, or Causal Ocean.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:52|Cc. Ādi 5.52]]
  : Surrounding Vaikuṇṭha is a mass of water that is endless, unfathomed and unlimited.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:53|Cc. Ādi 5.53]]
  : The earth, water, fire, air and ether of Vaikuṇṭha are all spiritual. Material elements are not found there.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:54|Cc. Ādi 5.54]]
  : The water of the Kāraṇa Ocean, which is the original cause, is therefore spiritual. The sacred Ganges, which is but a drop of it, purifies the fallen souls.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:55|Cc. Ādi 5.55]]
  : In that ocean lies one plenary portion of Lord Saṅkarṣaṇa.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:56|Cc. Ādi 5.56]]
  : He is known as the first puruṣa, the creator of the total material energy. He, the cause of the universes, the first incarnation, casts His glance over māyā.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:57|Cc. Ādi 5.57]]
  : Māyā-śakti resides outside the Causal Ocean. Māyā cannot touch its waters.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:58|Cc. Ādi 5.58]]
  : Māyā has two varieties of existence. One is called pradhāna or prakṛti. It supplies the ingredients of the material world.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:59|Cc. Ādi 5.59]]
  : Because prakṛti is dull and inert, it cannot actually be the cause of the material world. But Lord Kṛṣṇa shows His mercy by infusing His energy into the dull, inert material nature.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:60|Cc. Ādi 5.60]]
  : Thus prakṛti, by the energy of Lord Kṛṣṇa, becomes the secondary cause, just as iron becomes red-hot by the energy of fire.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:61|Cc. Ādi 5.61]]
  : Therefore Lord Kṛṣṇa is the original cause of the cosmic manifestation. Prakṛti is like the nipples on the neck of a goat, for they cannot give any milk.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:62|Cc. Ādi 5.62]]
  : The māyā aspect of material nature is the immediate cause of the cosmic manifestation. But it also cannot be the real cause, for the original cause is Lord Nārāyaṇa.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:63|Cc. Ādi 5.63]]
  : Just as the original cause of an earthen pot is the potter, so the creator of the material world is the first puruṣa incarnation [Kāraṇārṇavaśāyī Viṣṇu].

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:64|Cc. Ādi 5.64]]
  : Lord Kṛṣṇa is the creator, and māyā only helps Him as an instrument, just like the potter's wheel and other instruments, which are the instrumental causes of a pot.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:65|Cc. Ādi 5.65]]
  : The first puruṣa casts His glance at māyā from a distance, and thus He impregnates her with the seed of life in the form of the living entities.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:66|Cc. Ādi 5.66]]
  : The reflected rays of His body mix with māyā, and thus māyā gives birth to myriads of universes.
PURPORT

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:67|Cc. Ādi 5.67]]
  : The puruṣa enters each and every one of the countless universes. He manifests Himself in as many separate forms as there are universes.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:68|Cc. Ādi 5.68]]
  : When the puruṣa exhales, the universes become manifest with each outward breath.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:69|Cc. Ādi 5.69]]
  : Thereafter, when He inhales, all the universes again enter His body.
 //karma// from the previous cosmic manifestation. And the Lord Himself, by His partial representation, creates a body of innumerable universes and again enters each of those universes as Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu. His coming in contact with //māyā// is explained in the //Bhagavad-gītā// by a comparison between air and the sky. The sky enters everything material, yet it is far away from us.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:70|Cc. Ādi 5.70]]
  : Just as atomic particles of dust pass through the openings of a window, so the networks of universes pass through the pores of the skin of the puruṣa.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:71|Cc. Ādi 5.71]]
  : "The Brahmās and other lords of the mundane worlds appear from the pores of Mahā-Viṣṇu and remain alive for the duration of His one exhalation. I adore the primeval Lord, Govinda, of whom Mahā-Viṣṇu is a portion of a plenary portion."

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:72|Cc. Ādi 5.72]]
  : "Where am I, a small creature of seven spans the measure of my own hand? I am enclosed in the universe composed of material nature, the total material energy, false ego, ether, air, water and earth. And what is Your glory? Unlimited universes pass through the pores of Your body just like particles of dust passing through the opening of a window."

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:73|Cc. Ādi 5.73]]
  : A part of a part of a whole is called a kalā. Śrī Balarāma is the counterform of Lord Govinda.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:74|Cc. Ādi 5.74]]
  : Balarāma's own expansion is called Mahā-Saṅkarṣaṇa, and His fragment, the puruṣa, is counted as a kalā, or a part of a plenary portion.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:75|Cc. Ādi 5.75]]
  : I say that this kalā is Mahā-Viṣṇu. He is the Mahā-puruṣa, who is the source of the other puruṣas and who is all-pervading.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:76|Cc. Ādi 5.76]]
  : Garbhodaśāyī and Kṣīrodaśāyī are both called puruṣas. They are plenary portions of Kāraṇodaśāyī Viṣṇu, the first puruṣa, who is the abode of all the universes.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:77|Cc. Ādi 5.77]]
  : "Viṣṇu has three forms called puruṣas. The first, Mahā-Viṣṇu, is the creator of the total material energy [mahat], the second is Garbhodaśāyī, who is situated within each universe, and the third is Kṣīrodaśāyī, who lives in the heart of every living being. He who knows these three becomes liberated from the clutches of māyā.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:78|Cc. Ādi 5.78]]
  : Although Kṣīrodaśāyī Viṣṇu is called a kalā of Lord Kṛṣṇa, He is the source of Matsya, Kūrma and the other incarnations.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:79|Cc. Ādi 5.79]]
  : "All these incarnations of Godhead are either plenary portions or parts of the plenary portions of the puruṣa-avatāras. But Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. In every age He protects the world through His different features when the world is disturbed by the enemies of Indra."

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:80|Cc. Ādi 5.80]]
  : That puruṣa [Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu] is the performer of creation, maintenance and destruction. He manifests Himself in many incarnations, for He is the maintainer of the world.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:81|Cc. Ādi 5.81]]
  : That fragment of the Mahā-puruṣa who appears for the purpose of creation, maintenance and annihilation is called an incarnation.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:82|Cc. Ādi 5.82]]
  : That Mahā-puruṣa is identical with the Personality of Godhead. He is the original incarnation, the seed of all others, and the shelter of everything.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:83|Cc. Ādi 5.83]]
  : "The puruṣa is the primary incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Time, nature, prakṛti (as cause and effect), the mind, the material elements, false ego, the modes of nature, the senses, the universal form, complete independence and the moving and nonmoving beings appear subsequently as His opulences."

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:84|Cc. Ādi 5.84]]
  : "In the beginning of the creation, the Lord expanded Himself in the form of the puruṣa incarnation, accompanied by all the ingredients of material creation. First He created the sixteen principal energies suitable for creation. This was for the purpose of manifesting the material universes."

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:85|Cc. Ādi 5.85]]
  : Although the Lord is the shelter of everything and although all the universes rest in Him, He, as the Supersoul, is also the support of everything.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:86|Cc. Ādi 5.86]]
  : Although He is thus connected with the material energy in two ways, He does not have the slightest contact with it.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:87|Cc. Ādi 5.87]]
  : "This is the opulence of the Lord. Although situated within the material nature, He is never affected by the modes of nature. Similarly, those who have surrendered to Him and have fixed their intelligence upon Him are not influenced by the modes of nature."

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:88|Cc. Ādi 5.88]]
  : Thus the Bhagavad-gītā also states again and again that the Absolute Truth always possesses inconceivable power.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:89|Cc. Ādi 5.89]]
  : "I am situated in the material world, and the world rests in Me. But at the same time I am not situated in the material world, nor does it rest on Me in truth.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:90|Cc. Ādi 5.90]]
  : "O Arjuna, you should know this as My inconceivable opulence." This is the meaning propagated by Lord Kṛṣṇa in the Bhagavad-gītā.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:91|Cc. Ādi 5.91]]
  : That Mahā-puruṣa [Kāraṇodakaśāyī Viṣṇu] is known as a plenary part of Him who is Lord Nityānanda Balarāma, the favorite associate of Lord Caitanya.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:92|Cc. Ādi 5.92]]
  : I have thus explained the ninth verse, and now I shall explain the tenth. Please listen with rapt attention.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:93|Cc. Ādi 5.93]]
  : I offer my full obeisances unto the feet of Śrī Nityānanda Rāma, a partial part of whom is Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu. From the navel of Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu sprouts the lotus that is the birthplace of Brahmā, the engineer of the universe. The stem of that lotus is the resting place of the multitude of planets.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:94|Cc. Ādi 5.94]]
  : After creating millions of universes, the first puruṣa entered into each of them in a separate form, as Śrī Garbhodakaśāyī.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:95|Cc. Ādi 5.95]]
  : Entering the universe, He found only darkness, with no place in which to reside. Thus He began to consider.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:96|Cc. Ādi 5.96]]
  : Then He created water from the perspiration of His own body and with that water filled half the universe.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:97|Cc. Ādi 5.97]]
  : The universe measures five hundred million yojanas. Its length and breadth are one and the same.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:98|Cc. Ādi 5.98]]
  : After filling half the universe with water, He made His own residence therein and manifested the fourteen worlds in the other half.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:99|Cc. Ādi 5.99]]
  : There He manifested Vaikuṇṭha as His own abode and rested in the waters on the bed of Lord Śeṣa.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:100-101|Cc. Ādi 5.100-101]]
  : He lay there with Ananta as His bed. Lord Ananta is a divine serpent having thousands of heads, thousands of faces, thousands of eyes and thousands of hands and feet. He is the seed of all incarnations and is the cause of the material world.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:102|Cc. Ādi 5.102]]
  : From His navel grew a lotus flower, which became the birthplace of Lord Brahmā.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:103|Cc. Ādi 5.103]]
  : Within the stem of that lotus were the fourteen worlds. Thus the Supreme Lord, as Brahmā, created the entire creation.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:104|Cc. Ādi 5.104]]
  : And as Lord Viṣṇu He maintains the entire world. Lord Viṣṇu, being beyond all material attributes, has no touch with the material qualities.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:105|Cc. Ādi 5.105]]
  : Assuming the form of Rudra, He destroys the creation. Thus creation, maintenance and dissolution are created by His will.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:106|Cc. Ādi 5.106]]
  : He is the Supersoul, Hiraṇyagarbha, the cause of the material world. The universal form is conceived as His expansion.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:107|Cc. Ādi 5.107]]
  : That Lord Nārāyaṇa is a part of a plenary part of Lord Nityānanda Balarāma, who is the source of all incarnations.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:108|Cc. Ādi 5.108]]
  : I have thus explained the tenth verse. Now please listen to the meaning of the eleventh verse with all your mind.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:109|Cc. Ādi 5.109]]
  : I offer my respectful obeisances unto the feet of Śrī Nityānanda Rāma, whose secondary part is the Viṣṇu lying in the ocean of milk. That Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu is the Supersoul of all living entities and the maintainer of all the universes. Śeṣa Nāga is His further subpart.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:110|Cc. Ādi 5.110]]
  : The material planets rest within the stem that grew from the lotus navel of Lord Nārāyaṇa. Among these planets are seven oceans.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:111|Cc. Ādi 5.111]]
  : There, in part of the ocean of milk, lies Śvetadvīpa, the abode of the sustainer, Lord Viṣṇu.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:112|Cc. Ādi 5.112]]
  : He is the Supersoul of all living entities. He maintains this material world, and He is its Lord.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:113|Cc. Ādi 5.113]]
  : In the ages and millenniums of Manu, He appears as different incarnations to establish the principles of real religion and vanquish the principles of irreligion.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:114|Cc. Ādi 5.114]]
  : Unable to see Him, the demigods go to the bank of the ocean of milk and offer prayers to Him.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:115|Cc. Ādi 5.115]]
  : He then descends to maintain the material world. His unlimited opulences cannot be counted.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:116|Cc. Ādi 5.116]]
  : That Lord Viṣṇu is but a part of a part of a plenary portion of Lord Nityānanda, who is the source of all incarnations.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:117|Cc. Ādi 5.117]]
  : That same Lord Viṣṇu, in the form of Lord Śeṣa, holds the planets upon His heads, although He does not know where they are, for He cannot feel their existence upon His heads.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:118|Cc. Ādi 5.118]]
  : His thousands of extended hoods are adorned with dazzling jewels surpassing the sun.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:119|Cc. Ādi 5.119]]
  : The universe, which measures five hundred million yojanas in diameter, rests on one of His hoods like a mustard seed.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:120|Cc. Ādi 5.120]]
  : That Ananta Śeṣa is the devotee incarnation of Godhead. He knows nothing but service to Lord Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:121|Cc. Ādi 5.121]]
  : With His thousands of mouths He sings the glories of Lord Kṛṣṇa, but although He always sings in that way, He does not find an end to the qualities of the Lord.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:122|Cc. Ādi 5.122]]
  : The four Kumāras hear Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam from His lips, and they in turn repeat it in the transcendental bliss of love of Godhead.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:123|Cc. Ādi 5.123]]
  : He serves Lord Kṛṣṇa, assuming all the following forms: umbrella, slippers, bedding, pillow, garments, resting chair, residence, sacred thread and throne.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:124|Cc. Ādi 5.124]]
  : He is thus called Lord Śeṣa, for He has attained the ultimate end of servitude to Kṛṣṇa. He takes many forms for the service of Kṛṣṇa, and thus He serves the Lord.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:125|Cc. Ādi 5.125]]
  : That person of whom Lord Ananta is a kalā, or part of a plenary part, is Lord Nityānanda Prabhu. Who, therefore, can know the pastimes of Lord Nityānanda?

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:126|Cc. Ādi 5.126]]
  : From these conclusions we can know the limit of the truth of Lord Nityānanda. But what glory is there in calling Him Ananta?

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:127|Cc. Ādi 5.127]]
  : But I accept it as the truth because it has been said by devotees. Since He is the source of all incarnations, everything is possible in Him.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:128|Cc. Ādi 5.128]]
  : They know that there is no difference between the incarnation and the source of all incarnations. Previously Lord Kṛṣṇa was regarded in the light of different principles by different people.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:129|Cc. Ādi 5.129]]
  : Some said that Kṛṣṇa was directly Lord Nara-Nārāyaṇa, and some called Him Lord Vāmanadeva incarnate.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:130|Cc. Ādi 5.130]]
  : Some called Lord Kṛṣṇa an incarnation of Lord Kṣīrodakaśāyī. All these names are true; nothing is impossible.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:131|Cc. Ādi 5.131]]
  : When the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa appears, He is the shelter of all plenary parts. Thus at that time all His plenary portions join in Him.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:132|Cc. Ādi 5.132]]
  : In whatever form one knows the Lord, one speaks of Him in that way. In this there is no falsity, since everything is possible in Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:133|Cc. Ādi 5.133]]
  : Therefore Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu has exhibited to everyone all the pastimes of all the various incarnations.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:134|Cc. Ādi 5.134]]
  : Thus Lord Nityānanda has unlimited incarnations. In transcendental emotion He calls Himself a servant of Lord Caitanya.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:135|Cc. Ādi 5.135]]
  : Sometimes He serves Lord Caitanya as His guru, sometimes as His friend and sometimes as His servant, just as Lord Balarāma played with Lord Kṛṣṇa in these three different modes in Vraja.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:136|Cc. Ādi 5.136]]
  : Playing like a bull, Lord Balarāma fights with Kṛṣṇa head to head. And sometimes Lord Kṛṣṇa massages the feet of Lord Balarāma.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:137|Cc. Ādi 5.137]]
  : He considers Himself a servant and knows Kṛṣṇa to be His master. Thus He regards Himself as a fragment of His plenary portion.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:138|Cc. Ādi 5.138]]
  : "Acting just like ordinary boys, They played like roaring bulls as They fought each other, and They imitated the calls of various animals."

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:139|Cc. Ādi 5.139]]
  : "Sometimes when Lord Kṛṣṇa's elder brother, Lord Balarāma, felt tired after playing and lay His head on the lap of a cowherd boy, Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself served Him by massaging His feet."

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:140|Cc. Ādi 5.140]]
  : "Who is this mystic power, and where has she come from? Is she a demigod or a demoness? She must be the illusory energy of My master, Lord Kṛṣṇa, for who else can bewilder Me?"

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:141|Cc. Ādi 5.141]]
  : "What is the value of a throne to Lord Kṛṣṇa? The masters of the various planetary systems accept the dust of His lotus feet on their crowned heads. That dust makes the holy places sacred, and even Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva, Lakṣmī and I Myself, who are all portions of His plenary portion, eternally carry that dust on our heads."

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:142|Cc. Ādi 5.142]]
  : Lord Kṛṣṇa alone is the supreme controller, and all others are His servants. They dance as He makes them do so.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:143|Cc. Ādi 5.143]]
  : Thus Lord Caitanya is also the only controller. All others are His associates or servants.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:144-145|Cc. Ādi 5.144-145]]
  : His elders such as Lord Nityānanda, Advaita Ācārya and Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura, as well as His other devotees-whether His juniors, equals or superiors-are all His associates who help Him in His pastimes. Lord Gaurāṅga fulfills His aims with their help.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:146|Cc. Ādi 5.146]]
  : Śrī Advaita Ācārya and Śrīla Nityānanda Prabhu, who are plenary parts of the Lord, are His principal associates. With these two the Lord performs His pastimes in various ways.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:147|Cc. Ādi 5.147]]
  : Lord Advaita Ācārya is directly the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although Lord Caitanya accepts Him as His preceptor, Advaita Ācārya is a servant of the Lord.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:148|Cc. Ādi 5.148]]
  : I cannot describe the truth of Advaita Ācārya. He has delivered the entire world by making Lord Kṛṣṇa descend.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:149|Cc. Ādi 5.149]]
  : Lord Nityānanda Svarūpa formerly appeared as Lakṣmaṇa and served Lord Rāmacandra as His younger brother.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:150|Cc. Ādi 5.150]]
  : The activities of Lord Rāma were full of suffering, but Lakṣmaṇa, of His own accord, tolerated that suffering.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:151|Cc. Ādi 5.151]]
  : As a younger brother He could not stop Lord Rāma from His resolution, and so He remained silent, although unhappy in His mind.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:152|Cc. Ādi 5.152]]
  : When Lord Kṛṣṇa appeared, He [Balarāma] became His elder brother to serve Him to His heart's content and make Him enjoy all sorts of happiness.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:153|Cc. Ādi 5.153]]
  : Śrī Rāma and Śrī Lakṣmaṇa, who are plenary portions of Lord Kṛṣṇa and Lord Balarāma, entered into Them at the time of Kṛṣṇa's and Balarāma's appearance.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:154|Cc. Ādi 5.154]]
  : Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma present Themselves as elder or younger brother, but in the scriptures They are described as the original Supreme Personality of Godhead and His expansion.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:155|Cc. Ādi 5.155]]
  : "I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who by His various plenary portions appeared in the world in different forms and incarnations such as Lord Rāma, but who personally appears in His supreme original form as Lord Kṛṣṇa."

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:156|Cc. Ādi 5.156]]
  : Lord Caitanya is the same Lord Kṛṣṇa, and Lord Nityānanda is Lord Balarāma. Lord Nityānanda fulfills all of Lord Caitanya's desires.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:157|Cc. Ādi 5.157]]
  : The ocean of Lord Nityānanda's glories is infinite and unfathomable. Only by His mercy can I touch even a drop of it.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:158|Cc. Ādi 5.158]]
  : Please listen to another glory of His mercy. He made a fallen living entity climb to the highest limit.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:159|Cc. Ādi 5.159]]
  : To disclose it is not proper, for it should be kept as confidential as the Vedas, yet I shall speak of it to make His mercy known to all.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:160|Cc. Ādi 5.160]]
  : O Lord Nityānanda, I write of Your mercy out of great exultation. Please forgive me for my offenses.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:161|Cc. Ādi 5.161]]
  : Lord Nityānanda Prabhu had a servant named Śrī Mīnaketana Rāmadāsa, who was a reservoir of love.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:162|Cc. Ādi 5.162]]
  : At my house there was saṅkīrtana day and night, and therefore he visited there, having been invited.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:163|Cc. Ādi 5.163]]
  : Absorbed in emotional love, he sat in my courtyard, and all the Vaiṣṇavas bowed down at his feet.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:164|Cc. Ādi 5.164]]
  : In a joyful mood of love of God he sometimes climbed upon the shoulder of someone offering obeisances, and sometimes he struck others with his flute or mildly slapped them.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:165|Cc. Ādi 5.165]]
  : When someone saw the eyes of Mīnaketana Rāmadāsa, tears would automatically flow from his own eyes, for a constant shower of tears flowed from the eyes of Mīnaketana Rāmadāsa.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:166|Cc. Ādi 5.166]]
  : Sometimes there were eruptions of ecstasy like kadamba flowers on some parts of his body, and sometimes one limb would be stunned while another would be trembling.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:167|Cc. Ādi 5.167]]
  : Whenever he shouted aloud the name Nityānanda, the people around him were filled with great wonder and astonishment.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:168|Cc. Ādi 5.168]]
  : One respectable brāhmaṇa named Śrī Guṇārṇava Miśra was serving the Deity.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:169|Cc. Ādi 5.169]]
  : When Mīnaketana was seated in the yard, this brāhmaṇa did not offer him respect. Seeing this, Śrī Rāmadāsa became angry and spoke.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:170|Cc. Ādi 5.170]]
  : "Here I find the second Romaharṣaṇa-sūta, who did not stand to show honor when he saw Lord Balarāma."

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:171|Cc. Ādi 5.171]]
  : After saying this, he danced and sang to his heart's content, but the brāhmaṇa did not become angry, for he was then serving Lord Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:172|Cc. Ādi 5.172]]
  : At the end of the festival Mīnaketana Rāmadāsa went away, offering his blessings to everyone. At that time he had some controversy with my brother.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:173|Cc. Ādi 5.173]]
  : My brother had firm faith in Lord Caitanya but only a dim glimmer of faith in Lord Nityānanda.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:174|Cc. Ādi 5.174]]
  : Knowing this, Śrī Rāmadāsa felt unhappy in his mind. I then rebuked my brother.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:175|Cc. Ādi 5.175]]
  : "These two brothers," I told him, "are like one body; They are identical manifestations. If you do not believe in Lord Nityānanda, you will fall down.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:176|Cc. Ādi 5.176]]
  : "If you have faith in one but disrespect the other, your logic is like the logic of accepting half a hen.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:177|Cc. Ādi 5.177]]
  : "It would be better to be an atheist by slighting both brothers than a hypocrite by believing in one and slighting the other."

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:178|Cc. Ādi 5.178]]
  : Thus Śrī Rāmadāsa broke his flute in anger and went away, and at that time my brother fell down.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:179|Cc. Ādi 5.179]]
  : I have thus described the power of the servants of Lord Nityānanda. Now I shall describe another characteristic of His mercy.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:180|Cc. Ādi 5.180]]
  : That night Lord Nityānanda appeared to me in a dream because of my good quality in chastising my brother.

  : I fell at His feet, offering my obeisances, and He then placed His own lotus feet upon my head.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:183|Cc. Ādi 5.183]]
  : "Arise! Get up!" He told me again and again. Upon rising, I was greatly astonished to see His beauty.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:184|Cc. Ādi 5.184]]

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:185|Cc. Ādi 5.185]]
  : He had beautifully formed hands, arms and legs, and eyes like lotus flowers. He wore a silk cloth, with a silk turban on His head.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:186|Cc. Ādi 5.186]]

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:187|Cc. Ādi 5.187]]
  : His body was anointed with sandalwood pulp, and He was nicely decorated with tilaka. His movements surpassed those of a maddened elephant.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:188|Cc. Ādi 5.188]]
  : His face was more beautiful than millions upon millions of moons, and His teeth were like pomegranate seeds because of His chewing betel.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:189|Cc. Ādi 5.189]]
  : His body moved to and fro, right and left, for He was absorbed in ecstasy. He chanted "Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa" in a deep voice.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:190|Cc. Ādi 5.190]]
  : His red stick moving in His hand, He seemed like a maddened lion. All around the four sides of His feet were bumblebees.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:191|Cc. Ādi 5.191]]
  : His devotees, dressed like cowherd boys, surrounded His feet like so many bees and also chanted "Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa," absorbed in ecstatic love.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:192|Cc. Ādi 5.192]]
  : Some of them played horns and flutes, and others danced and sang. Some of them offered betel nuts, and others waved cāmara fans about Him.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:193|Cc. Ādi 5.193]]
  : Thus I saw such opulence in Lord Nityānanda Svarūpa. His wonderful form, qualities and pastimes are all transcendental.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:194|Cc. Ādi 5.194]]
  : I was overwhelmed with transcendental ecstasy, not knowing anything else. Then Lord Nityānanda smiled and spoke to me as follows.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:195|Cc. Ādi 5.195]]
  : "O my dear Kṛṣṇadāsa, do not be afraid. Go to Vṛndāvana, for there you will attain all things."

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:196|Cc. Ādi 5.196]]
  : After saying this, He directed me toward Vṛndāvana by waving His hand. Then He disappeared with His associates.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:197|Cc. Ādi 5.197]]
  : I fainted and fell to the ground, my dream broke, and when I regained consciousness I saw that morning had come.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:198|Cc. Ādi 5.198]]
  : I thought about what I had seen and heard and concluded that the Lord had ordered me to proceed to Vṛndāvana at once.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:199|Cc. Ādi 5.199]]
  : That very second I started for Vṛndāvana, and by His mercy I reached there in great happiness.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:200|Cc. Ādi 5.200]]
  : All glory, all glory to Lord Nityānanda Balarāma, by whose mercy I have attained shelter in the transcendental abode of Vṛndāvana.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:201|Cc. Ādi 5.201]]
  : All glory, all glory to the merciful Lord Nityānanda, by whose mercy I have attained shelter at the lotus feet of Śrī Rūpa and Śrī Sanātana.

  : By His mercy I have attained the shelter of the great personality Śrī Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī, and by His mercy I have found the refuge of Śrī Svarūpa Dāmodara.

  : By the mercy of Sanātana Gosvāmī I have learned the final conclusions of devotional service, and by the grace of Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī I have tasted the highest nectar of devotional service.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:204|Cc. Ādi 5.204]]
  : All glory, all glory to the lotus feet of Lord Nityānanda, by whose mercy I have attained Śrī Rādhā-Govinda.

  : I am more sinful than Jagāi and Mādhāi and even lower than the worms in the stool.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:206|Cc. Ādi 5.206]]
  : Anyone who hears my name loses the results of his pious activities. Anyone who utters my name becomes sinful.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:207|Cc. Ādi 5.207]]
  : Who in this world but Nityānanda could show His mercy to such an abominable person as me?

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:208|Cc. Ādi 5.208]]
  : Because He is intoxicated by ecstatic love and is an incarnation of mercy, He does not distinguish between the good and the bad.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:209|Cc. Ādi 5.209]]
  : He delivers all those who fall down before Him. Therefore He has delivered such a sinful and fallen person as me.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:210|Cc. Ādi 5.210]]
  : Although I am sinful and I am the most fallen, He has conferred upon me the lotus feet of Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:211|Cc. Ādi 5.211]]
  : I am not fit to speak all these confidential words about my visiting Lord Madana Gopāla and Lord Govinda.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:212|Cc. Ādi 5.212]]
  : Lord Madana Gopāla, the chief Deity of Vṛndāvana, is the enjoyer of the rāsa dance and is directly the son of the King of Vraja.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:213|Cc. Ādi 5.213]]
  : He enjoys the rāsa dance with Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, Śrī Lalitā and others. He manifests Himself as the Cupid of Cupids.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:214|Cc. Ādi 5.214]]
  : "Wearing yellow garments and decorated with a flower garland, Lord Kṛṣṇa, appearing among the gopīs with His smiling lotus face, looked directly like the charmer of the heart of Cupid."

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:215|Cc. Ādi 5.215]]
  : With Rādhā and Lalitā serving Him on His two sides, He attracts the hearts of all by His own sweetness.

  ; [[books:cc:adi:5:216|Cc. Ādi 5.216]]
  : The mercy of Lord Nityānanda showed me Śrī Madanamohana and gave me Śrī Madanamohana as my Lord and master.
