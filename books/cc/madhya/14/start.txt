====== Performance of the Vṛndāvana Pastimes ======

Dressing himself as a Vaiṣṇava, Mahārāja Pratāparudra entered a garden alone and began reciting verses from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// He then took the opportunity to massage the lotus feet of the Lord. The Lord, in His ecstatic love for Kṛṣṇa, immediately embraced the King and thus bestowed mercy upon him. When there was an offering of //prasāda// in the garden, Lord Caitanya also partook of it. After this, when Lord Jagannātha's Ratha car stopped moving, King Pratāparudra called for many elephants to pull it, but they were unsuccessful. Seeing this, Lord Caitanya began to push the car from behind with His head, and the chariot began moving. Then the devotees began pulling the chariot with ropes. Near the Guṇḍicā temple is a place known as Āiṭoṭā. This place was fixed up for Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to rest in. When Lord Jagannātha was seated at Sundarācala, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu saw it as Vṛndāvana. He performed sporting pastimes in the water of the lake known as Indradyumna. For nine continuous days during //Ratha-yātrā,// the Lord remained at Jagannātha Purī, and on the fifth day He and Svarūpa Dāmodara observed the pastimes of Lakṣmī, the goddess of fortune. During that time, there was much talk about the pastimes of the //gopīs.// When the //ratha// was again being drawn and the chanting resumed, Rāmānanda Vasu of Kulīna-grāma and Satyarāja Khān were requested to bring silk ropes every year for the //Ratha-yātrā// ceremony.

  : After saying this, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu began to recite the same verse again and again. Both the King and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu were trembling, and tears were flowing from their eyes.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:14:13|Cc. Madhya 14.13]]
  : "My Lord, the nectar of Your words and the descriptions of Your activities are the life and soul of those who are always aggrieved in this material world. These narrations are transmitted by exalted personalities, and they eradicate all sinful reactions. Whoever hears these narrations attains all good fortune. These narrations are broadcast all over the world and are filled with spiritual power. Those who spread the message of Godhead are certainly the most munificent welfare workers."

  : Finally Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "Who are you? You have done so much for Me. All of a sudden you have come here and made Me drink the nectar of the pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa."

  : All the devotees sat down in lines, and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu personally began to distribute the prasāda.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:14:40|Cc. Madhya 14.40]]
  : However, the devotees could not accept the prasāda until Caitanya Mahāprabhu took it. It was Svarūpa Gosvāmī who informed the Lord of this.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:14:41|Cc. Madhya 14.41]]

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:14:48|Cc. Madhya 14.48]]
  : When the gauḍas saw that they could not budge the car, they abandoned the attempt. Then the King arrived in great anxiety, and he was accompanied by his officers and friends.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:14:49|Cc. Madhya 14.49]]
  : The King then arranged for big wrestlers to try to pull the car, and even the King himself joined in, but the car could not be moved.

  : Indeed, the car began to move automatically, and the devotees simply carried the rope in their hands. Since it was moving effortlessly, they did not need to pull it.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:14:69|Cc. Madhya 14.69]]
  : Since they could not get one day each, two or three devotees combined to extend an invitation. These are the pastimes of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's acceptance of invitations.
