====== Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s Travels to the Holy Places ======

A summary of the Ninth Chapter is given by Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura. After leaving Vidyānagara, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu visited such places of pilgrimage as Gautamī-gaṅgā, Mallikārjuna, Ahovala-nṛsiṁha, Siddhavaṭa, Skanda-kṣetra, Trimaṭha, Vṛddhakāśī, Bauddha-sthāna, Tirupati, Tirumala, Pānā-nṛsiṁha, Śiva-kāñcī, Viṣṇu-kāñcī, Trikāla-hastī, Vṛddhakola, Śiyālī-bhairavī, Kāverī-tīra and Kumbhakarṇa-kapāla.

Finally the Lord went to Śrī Raṅga-kṣetra, where He converted a //brāhmaṇa// named Veṅkaṭa Bhaṭṭa, who, along with his family, became a devotee of Kṛṣṇa. After leaving Śrī Raṅga, Caitanya Mahāprabhu reached Ṛṣabha-parvata, where He met Paramānanda Purī, who later arrived at Jagannātha Purī. Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then proceeded farther, arriving at Setubandha Rāmeśvara. At Śrī Śaila-parvata, the Lord met Lord Śiva and his wife Durgā in the dress of a //brāhmaṇa// and //brāhmaṇī.// From there He went to Kāmakoṣṭhī-purī and later arrived at southern Mathurā. A //brāhmaṇa// devotee of Lord Rāmacandra's talked with Him. Then the Lord took His bath in the river Kṛtamālā. On the hill known as Mahendra-śaila, the Lord saw Paraśurāma. Then the Lord went to Setubandha and took His bath at Dhanus-tīrtha. He also visited Rāmeśvara, where He collected some papers connected with Sītādevī, whose illusory form was kidnapped by Rāvaṇa. The Lord next visited the places known as Pāṇḍya-deśa, Tāmraparṇī, Naya-tripadī, Ciyaḍatalā, Tila-kāñcī, Gajendra-mokṣaṇa, Pānāgaḍi, Cāmtāpura, Śrī Vaikuṇṭha, Malaya-parvata and Kanyā-kumārī. The Lord then met the Bhaṭṭathāris at Mallāra-deśa and saved Kālā Kṛṣṇadāsa from their clutches. The Lord also collected the //Brahma-saṁhitā,// Fifth Chapter, on the banks of the Payasvinī River. He then visited Payasvinī, Śṛṅgavera-purī-maṭha and Matsya-tīrtha. At the village of Uḍupī He saw the Gopāla Deity installed by Śrī Madhvācārya. He then defeated the Tattvavādīs in śāstric conversation. The Lord next visited Phalgu-tīrtha, Tritakūpa, Pañcāpsarā, Sūrpāraka and Kolāpura. At Śrī Raṅgapurī the Lord received news of Śaṅkarāraṇya's disappearance. He then went to the banks of the Kṛṣṇaveṇvā River, where He collected from among the Vaiṣṇava //brāhmaṇas// a book written by Bilvamaṅgala, //Kṛṣṇa-karṇāmṛta.// The Lord then visited Tāptī, Māhiṣmatī-pura, Narmadā-tīra and Ṛṣyamūka-parvata. He entered Daṇḍakāraṇya and liberated the seven palm trees. From there He visited a place known as Pampā-sarovara and visited Pañcavaṭī, Nāsika, Brahmagiri and also the source of the Godāvarī River, Kuśāvarta. Thus the Lord visited almost all the holy places in South India. He finally returned to Jagannātha Purī by taking the same route, after visiting Vidyānagara again.

  : Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu converted the inhabitants of South India. These people were as strong as elephants, but they were in the clutches of the crocodiles of various philosophies, such as the Buddhist, Jain and Māyāvāda philosophies. With His disc of mercy the Lord delivered them all by converting them into Vaiṣṇavas, devotees of the Lord.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:2|Cc. Madhya 9.2]]
  : All glories to Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu! All glories to Lord Nityānanda Prabhu! All glories to Śrī Advaita Prabhu! And all glories to the devotees of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu!

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:3|Cc. Madhya 9.3]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's tour of South India was certainly very extraordinary because He visited many thousands of places of pilgrimage there.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:4|Cc. Madhya 9.4]]
  : On the plea of visiting all those holy places, the Lord converted many thousands of residents and thus delivered them. Simply by touching the holy places, He made them into great places of pilgrimage.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:5|Cc. Madhya 9.5]]
  : I cannot chronologically record all the places of pilgrimage visited by Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. I can only summarize everything by saying that the Lord visited all holy places right and left, coming and going.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:6|Cc. Madhya 9.6]]
  : Because it is impossible for me to record all these places in chronological order, I simply make a token gesture of recording them.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:7-8|Cc. Madhya 9.7-8]]
  : As previously stated, all the residents of the villages visited by Lord Caitanya became Vaiṣṇavas and began to chant "Hari" and "Kṛṣṇa." In this way, in all the villages visited by the Lord, everyone became a Vaiṣṇava, a devotee.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:9|Cc. Madhya 9.9]]
  : In South India there were many types of people. Some were philosophical speculators, and some were fruitive workers, but in any case there were innumerable nondevotees.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:10|Cc. Madhya 9.10]]
  : By the influence of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, all these people abandoned their own opinions and became Vaiṣṇavas, devotees of Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:11|Cc. Madhya 9.11]]
  : At the time, all the South Indian Vaiṣṇavas were worshipers of Lord Rāmacandra. Some were Tattvavādīs, and some were followers of Rāmānujācārya.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:12|Cc. Madhya 9.12]]
  : After meeting Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, all those different Vaiṣṇavas became devotees of Kṛṣṇa and began chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:13|Cc. Madhya 9.13]]
  : " 'O Lord Rāmacandra, descendant of Mahārāja Raghu, kindly protect me! O Lord Kṛṣṇa, killer of the Keśī demon, kindly protect me!' "

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:14|Cc. Madhya 9.14]]
  : While walking on the road, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu used to chant this Rāma Rāghava mantra. Chanting in this way, He arrived at the banks of the Gautamī-gaṅgā and took His bath there.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:15|Cc. Madhya 9.15]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then went to Mallikārjuna-tīrtha and saw the deity of Lord Śiva there. He also induced all the people to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:16|Cc. Madhya 9.16]]
  : There he saw Lord Mahādeva [Śiva], the servant of Lord Rāma. He then went to Ahovala-nṛsiṁha.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:17|Cc. Madhya 9.17]]
  : After seeing the Ahovala-nṛsiṁha Deity, Caitanya Mahāprabhu offered many prayers unto the Lord. He then went to Siddhavaṭa, where He saw the Deity of Rāmacandra, the Lord of Sītādevī.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:18|Cc. Madhya 9.18]]
  : After seeing the Deity of Lord Rāmacandra, the descendant of King Raghu, the Lord offered His prayers and obeisances. Then a brāhmaṇa invited the Lord to take lunch.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:19|Cc. Madhya 9.19]]
  : That brāhmaṇa constantly chanted the holy name of Rāmacandra. Indeed, but for chanting Lord Rāmacandra's holy name, that brāhmaṇa did not speak a word.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:20|Cc. Madhya 9.20]]
  : That day, Lord Caitanya remained there and accepted prasāda at his house. After bestowing mercy upon him in this way, the Lord proceeded ahead.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:21|Cc. Madhya 9.21]]
  : At the holy place known as Skanda-kṣetra, Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu visited the temple of Skanda. From there He went to Trimaṭha, where He saw the Viṣṇu Deity Trivikrama.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:22|Cc. Madhya 9.22]]
  : After visiting the temple of Trivikrama, the Lord returned to Siddhavaṭa, where He again visited the house of the brāhmaṇa, who was now constantly chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:23|Cc. Madhya 9.23]]
  : After finishing His lunch there, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked the brāhmaṇa, "My dear friend, kindly tell Me what your position is now.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:24|Cc. Madhya 9.24]]
  : "Formerly you were constantly chanting the holy name of Lord Rāma. Why are you now constantly chanting the holy name of Kṛṣṇa?"

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:25|Cc. Madhya 9.25]]
  : The brāhmaṇa replied, "This is all due to Your influence, sir. After seeing You, I have lost my lifelong practice.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:26|Cc. Madhya 9.26]]
  : "From my childhood I have been chanting the holy name of Lord Rāmacandra, but upon seeing You I chanted the holy name of Lord Kṛṣṇa just once.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:27|Cc. Madhya 9.27]]
  : "Since then, the holy name of Kṛṣṇa has been tightly fixed upon my tongue. Indeed, since I have been chanting the holy name of Kṛṣṇa, the holy name of Lord Rāmacandra has gone far away.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:28|Cc. Madhya 9.28]]
  : "From my childhood I have been practicing this chanting and have been collecting the glories of the holy name from revealed scriptures.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:29|Cc. Madhya 9.29]]
  : " 'The Supreme Absolute Truth is called Rāma because the transcendentalists take pleasure in the unlimited true pleasure of spiritual existence.'

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:30|Cc. Madhya 9.30]]
  : " 'The word "kṛṣ" is the attractive feature of the Lord's existence, and "ṇa" means spiritual pleasure. When the verb "kṛṣ" is added to the affix "ṇa," it becomes "Kṛṣṇa," which indicates the Absolute Truth.'

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:31|Cc. Madhya 9.31]]
  : "As far as the holy names of Rāma and Kṛṣṇa are concerned, they are on an equal level, but for further advancement we receive some specific information from revealed scriptures.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:32|Cc. Madhya 9.32]]
  : " 'Lord Śiva addressed his wife Durgā as Varānanā and explained, "I chant the holy name of Rāma, Rāma, Rāma and thus enjoy this beautiful sound. This holy name of Rāmacandra is equal to one thousand holy names of Lord Viṣṇu."'

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:33|Cc. Madhya 9.33]]
  : " 'The pious results derived from chanting the thousand holy names of Viṣṇu three times can be attained by only one utterance of the holy name of Kṛṣṇa.'

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:34|Cc. Madhya 9.34]]
  : "According to this statement of the śāstras, the glories of the holy name of Kṛṣṇa are unlimited. Still I could not chant His holy name. Please hear the reason for this.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:35|Cc. Madhya 9.35]]
  : "My worshipable Lord has been Lord Rāmacandra, and by chanting His holy name I received happiness. Because I received such happiness, I chanted the holy name of Lord Rāma day and night.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:36|Cc. Madhya 9.36]]
  : "By Your appearance, Lord Kṛṣṇa's holy name also appeared, and at that time the glories of Kṛṣṇa's name awoke in my heart."

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:37|Cc. Madhya 9.37]]
  : The brāhmaṇa concluded, "Sir, You are that Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself. This is my conclusion." Saying this, the brāhmaṇa fell down at the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:38|Cc. Madhya 9.38]]
  : After showing mercy to the brāhmaṇa, Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu left the next day and arrived at Vṛddhakāśī, where He visited the temple of Lord Śiva.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:39|Cc. Madhya 9.39]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then left Vṛddhakāśī and proceeded further. In one village He saw that most of the residents were brāhmaṇas, and He took His rest there.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:40|Cc. Madhya 9.40]]
  : Due to the influence of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, many millions of men came just to see Him. Indeed, the assembly being unlimited, its members could not be counted.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:41|Cc. Madhya 9.41]]
  : The Lord's bodily features were very beautiful, and in addition He was always in the ecstasy of love of Godhead. Simply by seeing Him, everyone began chanting the holy name of Kṛṣṇa, and thus everyone became a Vaiṣṇava devotee.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:42|Cc. Madhya 9.42]]
  : There are many kinds of philosophers. Some are logicians who follow Gautama or Kaṇāda. Some follow the Mīmāṁsā philosophy of Jaimini. Some follow the Māyāvāda philosophy of Śaṅkarācārya, and others follow Kapila's Sāṅkhya philosophy or the mystic yoga system of Patañjali. Some follow the smṛti-śāstra composed of twenty religious scriptures, and others follow the Purāṇas and the tantra-śāstra. In this way there are many different types of philosophers.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:43|Cc. Madhya 9.43]]
  : All of these adherents of various scriptures were ready to present the conclusions of their respective scriptures, but Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu broke all their opinions to pieces and established His own cult of bhakti based on the Vedas, Vedānta, the Brahma-sūtra and the philosophy of acintya-bhedābheda-tattva.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:44|Cc. Madhya 9.44]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu established the devotional cult everywhere. No one could defeat Him.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:45|Cc. Madhya 9.45]]
  : Being thus defeated by Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, all these philosophers and their followers entered into His cult. In this way Lord Caitanya made South India into a country of Vaiṣṇavas.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:46|Cc. Madhya 9.46]]
  : When the nonbelievers heard of the erudition of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, they came to Him with great pride, bringing their disciples with them.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:47|Cc. Madhya 9.47]]
  : One of them was a leader of the Buddhist cult and was a very learned scholar. To establish the nine philosophical conclusions of Buddhism, he came before the Lord and began to speak.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:48|Cc. Madhya 9.48]]
  : Although the Buddhists are unfit for discussion and should not be seen by Vaiṣṇavas, Caitanya Mahāprabhu spoke to them just to decrease their false pride.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:49|Cc. Madhya 9.49]]
  : The scriptures of the Buddhist cult are chiefly based on argument and logic, and they contain nine chief principles. Because Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu defeated them in their argument, they could not establish their cult.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:50|Cc. Madhya 9.50]]
  : The teacher of the Buddhist cult set forth the nine principles, but Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu broke them to pieces with His strong logic.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:51|Cc. Madhya 9.51]]
  : All mental speculators and learned scholars were defeated by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and when the people began to laugh, the Buddhist philosophers felt both shame and fear.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:52|Cc. Madhya 9.52]]
  : The Buddhists could understand that Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was a Vaiṣṇava, and they returned home very unhappy. Later, however, they began to plot against the Lord.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:53|Cc. Madhya 9.53]]
  : Having made their plot, the Buddhists brought a plate of untouchable food before Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and called it mahā-prasāda.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:54|Cc. Madhya 9.54]]
  : When the contaminated food was offered to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, a very large bird appeared on the spot, picked up the plate in its beak and flew away.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:55|Cc. Madhya 9.55]]
  : Indeed, the untouchable food fell upon the Buddhists, and the large bird dropped the plate on the head of the chief Buddhist teacher. When it fell on his head, it made a big sound.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:56|Cc. Madhya 9.56]]
  : The plate was made of metal, and when its edge hit the head of the teacher, it cut him, and the teacher immediately fell to the ground unconscious.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:57|Cc. Madhya 9.57]]
  : When the teacher fell unconscious, his Buddhist disciples cried aloud and ran to the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu for shelter.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:58|Cc. Madhya 9.58]]
  : They all prayed to Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, addressing Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself and saying, "Sir, please excuse our offense. Please have mercy upon us and bring our spiritual master back to life."

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:59|Cc. Madhya 9.59]]
  : The Lord then replied to the Buddhist disciples, "You should all chant the names of Kṛṣṇa and Hari very loudly near the ear of your spiritual master.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:60|Cc. Madhya 9.60]]
  : "By this method your spiritual master will regain his consciousness." Following Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's advice, all the Buddhist disciples began to chant the holy name of Kṛṣṇa congregationally.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:61|Cc. Madhya 9.61]]
  : When all the disciples chanted the holy names Kṛṣṇa, Rāma and Hari, the Buddhist teacher regained consciousness and immediately began to chant the holy name of Lord Hari.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:62|Cc. Madhya 9.62]]
  : When the spiritual master of the Buddhists began to chant the holy name of Kṛṣṇa and submitted to Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, all the people who were gathered there were astonished.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:63|Cc. Madhya 9.63]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the son of Śacīdevī, then suddenly and humorously disappeared from everyone's sight, and it was impossible for anyone to find Him.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:64|Cc. Madhya 9.64]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu next arrived at Tirupati and Tirumala, where He saw a four-handed Deity. Then He next proceeded toward Veṅkaṭa Hill.

  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked the brāhmaṇa, "My dear sir, why are you in such ecstatic love? Which portion of the Bhagavad-gītā gives you such transcendental pleasure?"

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:98|Cc. Madhya 9.98]]
  : The brāhmaṇa replied, "I am illiterate and therefore do not know the meaning of the words. Sometimes I read the Bhagavad-gītā correctly and sometimes incorrectly, but in any case I am doing this in compliance with the orders of my spiritual master."

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:99|Cc. Madhya 9.99]]
  : The brāhmaṇa continued, "Actually I only see Lord Kṛṣṇa sitting on a chariot as Arjuna's charioteer. Taking the reins in His hands, He appears very beautiful and blackish.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:100|Cc. Madhya 9.100]]
  : "While seeing Lord Kṛṣṇa sitting in a chariot and instructing Arjuna, I am filled with ecstatic happiness.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:101|Cc. Madhya 9.101]]
  : "As long as I read the Bhagavad-gītā, I simply see the Lord's beautiful features. It is for this reason that I am reading the Bhagavad-gītā, and my mind cannot be distracted from this."

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:102|Cc. Madhya 9.102]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu told the brāhmaṇa, "Indeed, you are an authority in the reading of the Bhagavad-gītā. Whatever you know constitutes the real purport of the Bhagavad-gītā."

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:103|Cc. Madhya 9.103]]
  : After saying this, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu embraced the brāhmaṇa, and the brāhmaṇa, catching the lotus feet of the Lord, began to cry.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:104|Cc. Madhya 9.104]]
  : The brāhmaṇa said, "Upon seeing You, my happiness is doubled. I take it that You are the same Lord Kṛṣṇa."

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:105|Cc. Madhya 9.105]]
  : The mind of the brāhmaṇa was purified by the revelation of Lord Kṛṣṇa, and therefore he could understand the truth of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu in all details.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:106|Cc. Madhya 9.106]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then taught the brāhmaṇa very thoroughly and requested him not to disclose the fact that He was Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:107|Cc. Madhya 9.107]]
  : That brāhmaṇa became a great devotee of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and for four continuous months he did not give up the Lord's company.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:108|Cc. Madhya 9.108]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu remained at the house of Veṅkaṭa Bhaṭṭa and constantly talked with him about Lord Kṛṣṇa. In this way He was very happy.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:109|Cc. Madhya 9.109]]
  : Being a Vaiṣṇava in the Rāmānuja-sampradāya, Veṅkaṭa Bhaṭṭa worshiped the Deities of Lakṣmī and Nārāyaṇa. Seeing his pure devotion, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was very much satisfied.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:110|Cc. Madhya 9.110]]
  : Constantly associating with each other, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Veṅkaṭa Bhaṭṭa gradually developed a friendly relationship. Indeed, sometimes they laughed and joked together.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:111|Cc. Madhya 9.111]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu told the Bhaṭṭācārya, "Your worshipable goddess of fortune, Lakṣmī, always remains on the chest of Nārāyaṇa, and she is certainly the most chaste woman in the creation.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:112|Cc. Madhya 9.112]]
  : "However, my Lord is Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, a cowherd boy who is engaged in tending cows. Why is it that Lakṣmī, being such a chaste wife, wants to associate with My Lord?

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:113|Cc. Madhya 9.113]]
  : "Just to associate with Kṛṣṇa, Lakṣmī abandoned all transcendental happiness in Vaikuṇṭha and for a long time accepted vows and regulative principles and performed unlimited austerities."

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:114|Cc. Madhya 9.114]]
  : Caitanya Mahāprabhu then said, " 'O Lord, we do not know how the serpent Kāliya attained such an opportunity to be touched by the dust of Your lotus feet. Even the goddess of fortune, for this end, performed austerities for centuries, giving up all other desires and observing austere vows. Indeed, we do not know how the serpent Kāliya got such an opportunity."'

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:115|Cc. Madhya 9.115]]
  : Veṅkaṭa Bhaṭṭa then said, "Lord Kṛṣṇa and Lord Nārāyaṇa are one and the same, but the pastimes of Kṛṣṇa are more relishable due to their sportive nature.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:116|Cc. Madhya 9.116]]
  : "Since Kṛṣṇa and Nārāyaṇa are the same personality, Lakṣmī's association with Kṛṣṇa does not break her vow of chastity. Rather, it was in great fun that the goddess of fortune wanted to associate with Lord Kṛṣṇa."

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:117|Cc. Madhya 9.117]]
  : Veṅkaṭa Bhaṭṭa continued, " 'According to transcendental realization, there is no difference between the forms of Nārāyaṇa and Kṛṣṇa. Yet in Kṛṣṇa there is a special transcendental attraction due to the conjugal mellow, and consequently He surpasses Nārāyaṇa. This is the conclusion of transcendental mellows.'

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:118|Cc. Madhya 9.118]]
  : "The goddess of fortune considered that her vow of chastity would not be damaged by her relationship with Kṛṣṇa. Rather, by associating with Kṛṣṇa she could enjoy the benefit of the rāsa dance."

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:119|Cc. Madhya 9.119]]
  : Veṅkaṭa Bhaṭṭa further explained, "Mother Lakṣmī, the goddess of fortune, is also an enjoyer of transcendental bliss; therefore if she wanted to enjoy herself with Kṛṣṇa, what fault is there? Why are You joking so about this?"

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:120|Cc. Madhya 9.120]]
  : Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu replied, "I know that there is no fault on the part of the goddess of fortune, but still she could not enter into the rāsa dance. We hear this from revealed scriptures.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:121|Cc. Madhya 9.121]]
  : " 'When Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa was dancing with the gopīs in the rāsa-līlā, He put His arms around their necks and embraced them. This transcendental favor was never bestowed upon the goddess of fortune or the other consorts in the spiritual world. Nor was such a thing ever imagined by the most beautiful girls in the heavenly planets, girls whose bodily luster and aroma exactly resemble the lotus flower. And what to speak of worldly women, who may be very, very beautiful according to material estimation?'

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:122|Cc. Madhya 9.122]]
  : "But can you tell Me why the goddess of fortune, Lakṣmī, could not enter the rāsa dance? The authorities of Vedic knowledge could enter the dance and associate with Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:123|Cc. Madhya 9.123]]
  : " 'Great sages conquer the mind and senses by practicing the mystic yoga system and controlling the breath. Thus engaging in mystic yoga, they see the Supersoul within their hearts and ultimately enter into impersonal Brahman. But even the enemies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead attain that position simply by thinking of the Supreme Lord. However, the damsels of Vraja, the gopīs, being attracted by the beauty of Kṛṣṇa, simply wanted to embrace Him and His arms, which are like serpents. Thus the gopīs ultimately tasted the nectar of the lotus feet of the Lord. Similarly, we Upaniṣads can also taste the nectar of His lotus feet by following in the footsteps of the gopīs.' "

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:124|Cc. Madhya 9.124]]
  : Having been asked by Caitanya Mahāprabhu why the goddess of fortune could not enter into the rāsa dance whereas the authorities on Vedic knowledge could, Veṅkaṭa Bhaṭṭa replied, "I cannot enter into the mysteries of this behavior."

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:125|Cc. Madhya 9.125]]
  : Veṅkaṭa Bhaṭṭa then admitted, "I am an ordinary human being. Since my intelligence is very much limited and I am easily agitated, my mind cannot enter within the deep ocean of the pastimes of the Lord.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:126|Cc. Madhya 9.126]]
  : "You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa Himself. You know the purpose of Your activities, and the person whom You enlighten can also understand Your pastimes."

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:127|Cc. Madhya 9.127]]
  : The Lord replied, "Lord Kṛṣṇa has a special characteristic: He attracts everyone's heart by the mellow of His personal conjugal love.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:128|Cc. Madhya 9.128]]
  : "By following in the footsteps of the inhabitants of the planet known as Vrajaloka or Goloka Vṛndāvana one can attain the shelter of the lotus feet of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. However, in that planet the inhabitants do not know that Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:129|Cc. Madhya 9.129]]
  : "There someone may accept Him as a son and sometimes bind Him to a grinding mortar. Someone else may accept Him as an intimate friend and, attaining victory over Him, playfully mount His shoulders.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:130|Cc. Madhya 9.130]]
  : "The inhabitants of Vrajabhūmi know Kṛṣṇa as the son of Mahārāja Nanda, the King of Vrajabhūmi, and they consider that they can have no relationship with the Lord in the rasa of opulence.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:131|Cc. Madhya 9.131]]
  : "One who worships the Lord by following in the footsteps of the inhabitants of Vrajabhūmi attains Him in the transcendental planet of Vraja, where He is known as the son of Mahārāja Nanda."

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:132|Cc. Madhya 9.132]]
  : Caitanya Mahāprabhu then quoted, " 'The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, the son of mother Yaśodā, is accessible to those devotees engaged in spontaneous loving service, but He is not as easily accessible to mental speculators, to those striving for self-realization by severe austerities and penances, or to those who consider the body the same as the self.'

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:133|Cc. Madhya 9.133]]
  : "The authorities in the Vedic literature who are known as the śruti-gaṇa worshiped Lord Kṛṣṇa in the ecstasy of the gopīs and followed in their footsteps.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:134|Cc. Madhya 9.134]]
  : "The personified authorities on the Vedic hymns acquired bodies like those of the gopīs and took birth in Vrajabhūmi. In those bodies they were allowed to enter into the Lord's rāsa-līlā dance.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:135|Cc. Madhya 9.135]]
  : "Lord Kṛṣṇa belongs to the cowherd community, and the gopīs are the dearmost lovers of Kṛṣṇa. Although the wives of the denizens of the heavenly planets are most opulent within the material world, neither they nor any other women in the material universe can acquire Kṛṣṇa's association.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:136|Cc. Madhya 9.136]]
  : "The goddess of fortune, Lakṣmī, wanted to enjoy Kṛṣṇa and at the same time retain her spiritual body in the form of Lakṣmī. However, she did not follow in the footsteps of the gopīs in her worship of Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:137|Cc. Madhya 9.137]]
  : "Vyāsadeva, the supreme authority on Vedic literature, composed the verse beginning 'nāyaṁ sukhāpo bhagavān' because no one can enter into the rāsa-līlā dance in any body other than that of a gopī."

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:138|Cc. Madhya 9.138]]
  : Before this explanation was given by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Veṅkaṭa Bhaṭṭa thought that Śrī Nārāyaṇa was the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:139|Cc. Madhya 9.139]]
  : Thinking in this way, Veṅkaṭa Bhaṭṭa believed that worship of Nārāyaṇa was the supreme form of worship, superior to all other processes of devotional service, for it was followed by the Śrī Vaiṣṇava disciples of Rāmānujācārya.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:140|Cc. Madhya 9.140]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu had understood this misconception of Veṅkaṭa Bhaṭṭa's, and to correct it the Lord talked so much in a joking way.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:141|Cc. Madhya 9.141]]
  : The Lord then continued, "My dear Veṅkaṭa Bhaṭṭa, please do not continue doubting. Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and this is the conclusion of the Vedic literature.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:142|Cc. Madhya 9.142]]
  : "Lord Nārāyaṇa, the opulent form of Kṛṣṇa, attracts the minds of the goddess of fortune and her followers.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:143|Cc. Madhya 9.143]]
  : " 'All these incarnations of Godhead are either plenary portions or parts of the plenary portions of the puruṣa-avatāras. But Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. In every age He protects the world through His different features when the world is disturbed by the enemies of Indra.'

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:144|Cc. Madhya 9.144]]
  : "Because Kṛṣṇa has four extraordinary qualities not possessed by Lord Nārāyaṇa, the goddess of fortune, Lakṣmī, always desires His company.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:145|Cc. Madhya 9.145]]
  : "You have recited the śloka beginning with 'siddhāntatas tv abhede 'pi.' That very verse is evidence that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:146|Cc. Madhya 9.146]]
  : " 'According to transcendental realization, there is no difference between the forms of Kṛṣṇa and Nārāyaṇa. Yet in Kṛṣṇa there is a special transcendental attraction due to the conjugal mellow, and consequently He surpasses Nārāyaṇa. This is the conclusion of transcendental mellows.'

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:147|Cc. Madhya 9.147]]
  : "The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, attracts the mind of the goddess of fortune, but Lord Nārāyaṇa cannot attract the minds of the gopīs. This proves the superexcellence of Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:148|Cc. Madhya 9.148]]
  : "To say nothing of Lord Nārāyaṇa personally, Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself appeared as Nārāyaṇa just to play a joke on the gopīs.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:149|Cc. Madhya 9.149]]
  : "Although Kṛṣṇa assumed the four-armed form of Nārāyaṇa, He could not attract the serious attention of the gopīs in ecstatic love.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:150|Cc. Madhya 9.150]]
  : " 'Once Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa playfully manifested Himself as Nārāyaṇa, with four victorious hands and a very beautiful form. When the gopīs saw this exalted form, however, their ecstatic feelings were crippled. A learned scholar, therefore, cannot understand the gopīs' ecstatic feelings, which are firmly fixed upon the original form of Lord Kṛṣṇa as the son of Nanda Mahārāja. The wonderful feelings of the gopīs in ecstatic parama-rasa with Kṛṣṇa constitute the greatest mystery in spiritual life.' "

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:151|Cc. Madhya 9.151]]
  : In this way Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu deflated the pride of Veṅkaṭa Bhaṭṭa, but just to make him happy again, He spoke as follows.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:152|Cc. Madhya 9.152]]
  : The Lord pacified Veṅkaṭa Bhaṭṭa by saying, "Actually whatever I have said is by way of jest. Now you can hear from Me the conclusion of the śāstras, in which every Vaiṣṇava devotee has firm faith.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:153|Cc. Madhya 9.153]]
  : "There is no difference between Lord Kṛṣṇa and Lord Nārāyaṇa, for They are of the same form. Similarly, there is no difference between the gopīs and the goddess of fortune, for they also are of the same form.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:154|Cc. Madhya 9.154]]
  : "The goddess of fortune enjoys the association of Kṛṣṇa through the gopīs. One should not see a difference between the forms of the Lord, for such a conception is offensive.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:155|Cc. Madhya 9.155]]
  : "There is no difference between the transcendental forms of the Lord. Different forms are manifest due to different attachments of different devotees. Actually the Lord is one, but He appears in different forms just to satisfy His devotees.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:156|Cc. Madhya 9.156]]
  : " 'When the jewel known as vaidūrya touches various other materials, it appears to be separated into different colors, and consequently its forms also appear different. Similarly, according to the meditational ecstasy of the devotee, the Lord, who is known as Acyuta [infallible], appears in different forms, although He is essentially one.' "

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:157|Cc. Madhya 9.157]]
  : Veṅkaṭa Bhaṭṭa then said, "I am an ordinary fallen living entity, but You are Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:158|Cc. Madhya 9.158]]
  : "The transcendental pastimes of the Lord are unfathomable, and I do not know anything about them. Whatever You say I accept as the truth.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:159|Cc. Madhya 9.159]]
  : "I have been engaged in the service of Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa, and it is due to Their mercy that I have been able to see Your lotus feet.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:160|Cc. Madhya 9.160]]
  : "Out of Your causeless mercy You have told me of the glories of Lord Kṛṣṇa. No one can reach the end of the opulence, qualities and forms of the Lord.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:161|Cc. Madhya 9.161]]
  : "I can now understand that devotional service unto Lord Kṛṣṇa is the supreme form of worship. Out of Your causeless mercy You have made my life successful simply by explaining the facts."

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:162|Cc. Madhya 9.162]]
  : After saying this, Veṅkaṭa Bhaṭṭa fell down before the lotus feet of the Lord, and the Lord, out of His causeless mercy, embraced him.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:163|Cc. Madhya 9.163]]
  : When the period of Cāturmāsya was completed, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu took permission to leave Veṅkaṭa Bhaṭṭa, and after visiting Śrī Raṅga He proceeded further toward southern India.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:164|Cc. Madhya 9.164]]
  : Veṅkaṭa Bhaṭṭa did not want to return home but also wanted to go with the Lord. It was with great endeavor that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu bade him farewell.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:165|Cc. Madhya 9.165]]
  : When He did so, Veṅkaṭa Bhaṭṭa fell down unconscious. Such are the pastimes of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the son of mother Śacī, at Śrī Raṅga-kṣetra.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:166|Cc. Madhya 9.166]]
  : When the Lord arrived at Ṛṣabha Hill, He saw the temple of Lord Nārāyaṇa and offered obeisances and various prayers.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:167|Cc. Madhya 9.167]]
  : Paramānanda Purī was staying at Ṛṣabha Hill during the four months of the rainy season, and when Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu heard this, He immediately went to see him.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:168|Cc. Madhya 9.168]]
  : Upon meeting Paramānanda Purī, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu offered him all respects, touching his lotus feet, and Paramānanda Purī embraced the Lord in ecstasy.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:169|Cc. Madhya 9.169]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu stayed with Paramānanda Purī in the brāhmaṇa's house where he was residing. The two of them passed three days there discussing topics of Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:170|Cc. Madhya 9.170]]
  : Paramānanda Purī informed Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu that he was going to see Puruṣottama at Jagannātha Purī. After seeing Lord Jagannātha there, he would go to Bengal to bathe in the Ganges.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:171|Cc. Madhya 9.171]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then told him, "Please return to Jagannātha Purī, for I will return there very soon from Rāmeśvara [Setubandha].

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:172|Cc. Madhya 9.172]]
  : "It is My desire to stay with you, and therefore if you would return to Jagannātha Purī, you would show great mercy to Me."

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:173|Cc. Madhya 9.173]]
  : After talking in this way with Paramānanda Purī, the Lord took his permission to leave and, very much pleased, departed for southern India.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:174|Cc. Madhya 9.174]]
  : Thus Paramānanda Purī started for Jagannātha Purī, and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu began walking toward Śrī Śaila.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:175|Cc. Madhya 9.175]]
  : It was in Śrī Śaila that Lord Śiva and his wife Durgā lived in the dress of brāhmaṇas, and when they saw Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, they became very much pleased.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:176|Cc. Madhya 9.176]]
  : Lord Śiva, dressed like a brāhmaṇa, gave alms to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and invited Him to spend three days in a solitary place. Sitting there together, they talked very confidentially.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:177|Cc. Madhya 9.177]]
  : After talking with Lord Śiva, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu took his permission to leave and went to Kāmakoṣṭhī-purī.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:178|Cc. Madhya 9.178]]
  : When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu arrived at southern Mathurā from Kāmakoṣṭhī, He met a brāhmaṇa.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:179|Cc. Madhya 9.179]]
  : The brāhmaṇa who met Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu invited the Lord to his home. This brāhmaṇa was a great devotee and an authority on Lord Śrī Rāmacandra. He was always detached from material activities.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:180|Cc. Madhya 9.180]]
  : After bathing in the river Kṛtamālā, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu went to the brāhmaṇa's house to take lunch, but He saw that the food was unprepared because the brāhmaṇa had not cooked it.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:181|Cc. Madhya 9.181]]
  : Seeing this, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "My dear sir, please tell Me why you have not cooked. It is already noon."

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:182|Cc. Madhya 9.182]]
  : The brāhmaṇa replied, "My dear Lord, we are living in the forest. For the time being we cannot get all the ingredients for cooking.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:183|Cc. Madhya 9.183]]
  : "When Lakṣmaṇa brings all the vegetables, fruits and roots from the forest, Sītā will do the necessary cooking."

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:184|Cc. Madhya 9.184]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was very much satisfied to hear about the brāhmaṇa's method of worship. Finally the brāhmaṇa hastily made arrangements for cooking.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:185|Cc. Madhya 9.185]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu took His lunch at about three o'clock, but the brāhmaṇa, being very sorrowful, fasted.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:186|Cc. Madhya 9.186]]
  : While the brāhmaṇa was fasting, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked him, "Why are you fasting? Why are you so unhappy? Why are you so worried?"

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:187|Cc. Madhya 9.187]]
  : The brāhmaṇa replied, "I have no reason to live. I shall give up my life by entering either fire or water.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:188|Cc. Madhya 9.188]]
  : "My dear Sir, mother Sītā is the mother of the universe and the supreme goddess of fortune. She has been touched by the demon Rāvaṇa, and I am troubled upon hearing this news.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:189|Cc. Madhya 9.189]]
  : "Sir, due to my unhappiness I cannot continue living. Although my body is burning, my life is not leaving."

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:190|Cc. Madhya 9.190]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu replied, "Please do not think this way any longer. You are a learned paṇḍita. Why don't you consider the case?"

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:191|Cc. Madhya 9.191]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu continued, "Sītādevī, the dearmost wife of the Supreme Lord Rāmacandra, certainly has a spiritual form full of bliss. No one can see her with material eyes, for no materialist has such power.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:192|Cc. Madhya 9.192]]
  : "To say nothing of touching mother Sītā, a person with material senses cannot even see her. When Rāvaṇa kidnapped her, he kidnapped only her material, illusory form.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:193|Cc. Madhya 9.193]]
  : "As soon as Rāvaṇa arrived before Sītā, she disappeared. Then just to cheat Rāvaṇa she sent an illusory, material form.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:194|Cc. Madhya 9.194]]
  : "Spiritual substance is never within the jurisdiction of the material conception. This is always the verdict of the Vedas and Purāṇas."

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:195|Cc. Madhya 9.195]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then assured the brāhmaṇa, "Have faith in My words and do not burden your mind any longer with this misconception."

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:196|Cc. Madhya 9.196]]
  : Although the brāhmaṇa was fasting, he had faith in the words of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and accepted food. In this way his life was saved.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:197|Cc. Madhya 9.197]]
  : After thus assuring the brāhmaṇa, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu proceeded further into southern India and finally arrived at Durvaśana, where He bathed in the river Kṛtamālā.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:198|Cc. Madhya 9.198]]
  : At Durvaśana Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu visited the temple of Lord Rāmacandra, and on the hill known as Mahendra-śaila He saw Lord Paraśurāma.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:199|Cc. Madhya 9.199]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then went to Setubandha [Rāmeśvara], where He took His bath at the place called Dhanustīrtha. From there He visited the Rāmeśvara temple and then took rest.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:200|Cc. Madhya 9.200]]
  : There, among the brāhmaṇas, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu listened to the Kūrma Purāṇa, wherein was mentioned the chaste woman's narration.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:201|Cc. Madhya 9.201]]
  : Śrīmatī Sītādevī is the mother of the three worlds and the wife of Lord Rāmacandra. Among chaste women she is supreme, and she is the daughter of King Janaka.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:202|Cc. Madhya 9.202]]
  : When Rāvaṇa came to kidnap mother Sītā and she saw him, she took shelter of the fire-god, Agni. The fire-god covered the body of mother Sītā, and in this way she was protected from the hands of Rāvaṇa.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:203|Cc. Madhya 9.203]]
  : Upon hearing from the Kūrma Purāṇa how Rāvaṇa had kidnapped a false form of mother Sītā, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu became very much satisfied.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:204|Cc. Madhya 9.204]]
  : The fire-god, Agni, took away the real Sītā and brought her to the place of Pārvatī, goddess Durgā. An illusory form of mother Sītā was then delivered to Rāvaṇa, and in this way Rāvaṇa was cheated.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:205|Cc. Madhya 9.205]]
  : After Rāvaṇa was killed by Lord Rāmacandra, Sītādevī was brought before the fire and tested.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:206|Cc. Madhya 9.206]]
  : When the illusory Sītā was brought before the fire by Lord Rāmacandra, the fire-god made the illusory form disappear and delivered the real Sītā to Lord Rāmacandra.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:207|Cc. Madhya 9.207]]
  : When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu heard this story, He was very much pleased, and He remembered the words of Rāmadāsa Vipra.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:208|Cc. Madhya 9.208]]
  : Indeed, when Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu heard these conclusive statements from the Kūrma Purāṇa, He felt great happiness. After asking the brāhmaṇas' permission, He took possession of those manuscript leaves.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:209|Cc. Madhya 9.209]]
  : Since the Kūrma Purāṇa was very old, the manuscript was also very old. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu took possession of the original leaves in order to have direct evidence. The text was copied onto new leaves in order that the Purāṇa be replaced.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:210|Cc. Madhya 9.210]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu returned to southern Mathurā [Madurai] and delivered the original manuscript of the Kūrma Purāṇa to Rāmadāsa Vipra.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:211-212|Cc. Madhya 9.211-212]]
  : "When he was petitioned by mother Sītā, the fire-god, Agni, brought forth an illusory form of Sītā, and Rāvaṇa, who had ten heads, kidnapped the false Sītā. The original Sītā then went to the abode of the fire-god. When Lord Rāmacandra tested the body of Sītā, it was the false, illusory Sītā that entered the fire. At that time the fire-god brought the original Sītā from his abode and delivered her to Lord Rāmacandra."

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:213|Cc. Madhya 9.213]]
  : Rāmadāsa Vipra was very much pleased to receive the original leaf manuscript of the Kūrma Purāṇa, and he immediately fell down before the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and began to cry.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:214|Cc. Madhya 9.214]]
  : After receiving the manuscript, the brāhmaṇa, being very much pleased, said, "Sir, You are Lord Rāmacandra Himself and have come in the dress of a sannyāsī to give me audience.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:215|Cc. Madhya 9.215]]
  : "My dear Sir, You have delivered me from a very unhappy condition. I request that You take Your lunch at my place. Please accept this invitation.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:216|Cc. Madhya 9.216]]
  : "Due to my mental distress I could not give You a very nice lunch the other day. Now, by good fortune, You have come again to my home."

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:217|Cc. Madhya 9.217]]
  : Saying this, the brāhmaṇa very happily cooked food, and a first-class dinner was offered to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:218|Cc. Madhya 9.218]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu passed that night in the house of the brāhmaṇa. Then, after showing him mercy, the Lord started toward Tāmraparṇī in Pāṇḍya-deśa.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:219|Cc. Madhya 9.219]]
  : There was also a temple of Lord Viṣṇu at Naya-tripati on the bank of the river Tāmraparṇī, and after bathing in the river, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu saw the Deity with great curiosity and wandered on.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:220|Cc. Madhya 9.220]]
  : After this, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu went to a holy place known as Ciyaḍatalā, where He saw the Deities of the two brothers Lord Rāmacandra and Lakṣmaṇa. He then proceeded to Tila-kāñcī, where He saw the temple of Lord Śiva.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:221|Cc. Madhya 9.221]]
  : Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then visited the holy place named Gajendra-mokṣaṇa, where He went to a temple of Lord Viṣṇu. He then came to Pānāgaḍi, a holy place where He saw the Deities of Lord Rāmacandra and Sītā.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:222|Cc. Madhya 9.222]]
  : Later the Lord went to Cāmtāpura, where He saw the Deities of Lord Rāmacandra and Lakṣmaṇa. He then went to Śrī Vaikuṇṭha and saw the temple of Lord Viṣṇu there.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:223|Cc. Madhya 9.223]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then went to Malaya-parvata and offered prayers to Agastya Muni. He then visited Kanyā-kumārī [Cape Comorin].

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:224|Cc. Madhya 9.224]]
  : After visiting Kanyā-kumārī, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu came to Āmlitalā, where He saw the Deity of Śrī Rāmacandra. Thereafter He went to a place known as Mallāra-deśa, where a community of Bhaṭṭathāris lived.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:225|Cc. Madhya 9.225]]
  : After visiting Mallāra-deśa, Caitanya Mahāprabhu went to Tamāla-kārtika and then to Vetāpani. There He saw the temple of Raghunātha, Lord Rāmacandra, and passed the night.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:226|Cc. Madhya 9.226]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was accompanied by His servant, Kṛṣṇadāsa. He was a brāhmaṇa, but he met with the Bhaṭṭathāris there.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:227|Cc. Madhya 9.227]]
  : With women the Bhaṭṭathāris allured the brāhmaṇa Kṛṣṇadāsa, who was simple and gentle. By virtue of their bad association, they polluted his intelligence.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:228|Cc. Madhya 9.228]]
  : Allured by the Bhaṭṭathāris, Kṛṣṇadāsa went to their place early in the morning. The Lord also went there very quickly just to find him out.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:229|Cc. Madhya 9.229]]
  : Upon reaching their community, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked the Bhaṭṭathāris, "Why are you keeping My brāhmaṇa assistant?

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:230|Cc. Madhya 9.230]]
  : "I am in the renounced order of life, and so are you. Yet you are purposefully giving Me pain, and I do not see any good logic in this."

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:231|Cc. Madhya 9.231]]
  : Upon hearing Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, all the Bhaṭṭathāris came running from all sides with weapons in their hands, desiring to hurt the Lord.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:232|Cc. Madhya 9.232]]
  : However, their weapons fell from their hands and struck their own bodies. When some of the Bhaṭṭathāris were thus cut to pieces, the others ran away in the four directions.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:233|Cc. Madhya 9.233]]
  : While there was much roaring and crying at the Bhaṭṭathāri community, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu grabbed Kṛṣṇadāsa by the hair and took him away.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:234|Cc. Madhya 9.234]]
  : That very night, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His assistant Kṛṣṇadāsa arrived at the bank of the Payasvinī River. They took their bath and then went to see the temple of Ādi-keśava.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:235|Cc. Madhya 9.235]]
  : When the Lord saw the Ādi-keśava temple, He was immediately overwhelmed with ecstasy. Offering various obeisances and prayers, He chanted and danced.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:236|Cc. Madhya 9.236]]
  : All the people there were greatly astonished to see the ecstatic pastimes of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. They all received the Lord very well.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:237|Cc. Madhya 9.237]]
  : In the temple of Ādi-keśava, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu discussed spiritual matters among highly advanced devotees. While there, He found a chapter of the Brahma-saṁhitā.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:238|Cc. Madhya 9.238]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was greatly happy to find a chapter of that scripture, and symptoms of ecstatic transformation-trembling, tears, perspiration, trance and jubilation-were manifest in His body.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:239-240|Cc. Madhya 9.239-240]]
  : There is no scripture equal to the Brahma-saṁhitā as far as the final spiritual conclusion is concerned. Indeed, that scripture is the supreme revelation of the glories of Lord Govinda, for it reveals the topmost knowledge about Him. Since all conclusions are briefly presented in the Brahma-saṁhitā, it is essential among all the Vaiṣṇava scriptures.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:241|Cc. Madhya 9.241]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu copied the Brahma-saṁhitā and afterwards, with great pleasure, went to a place known as Ananta Padmanābha.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:242|Cc. Madhya 9.242]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu remained for two or three days at Ananta Padmanābha and visited the temple there. Then, in great ecstasy He went to see the temple of Śrī Janārdana.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:243|Cc. Madhya 9.243]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu chanted and danced at Śrī Janārdana for two days. He then went to the bank of the Payasvinī River and visited the temple of Śaṅkara-nārāyaṇa.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:244|Cc. Madhya 9.244]]
  : Then He saw the monastery known as Śṛṅgeri-maṭha, the abode of Ācārya Śaṅkara. He then visited Matsya-tīrtha, a place of pilgrimage, and took a bath in the river Tuṅgabhadrā.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:245|Cc. Madhya 9.245]]
  : Caitanya Mahāprabhu next arrived at Uḍupī, the place of Madhvācārya, where the philosophers known as Tattvavādīs resided. There He saw the Deity of Lord Kṛṣṇa and became mad with ecstasy.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:246|Cc. Madhya 9.246]]
  : While at the Uḍupī monastery, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu saw "dancing Gopāla," a most beautiful Deity. This Deity appeared to Madhvācārya in a dream.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:247|Cc. Madhya 9.247]]
  : Madhvācārya had somehow or other acquired the Deity of Kṛṣṇa from a heap of gopī-candana that had been transported in a boat.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:248|Cc. Madhya 9.248]]
  : Madhvācārya brought this dancing Gopāla Deity to Uḍupī and installed Him in the temple. To date, the followers of Madhvācārya, known as Tattvavādīs, worship this Deity.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:249|Cc. Madhya 9.249]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu received great pleasure in seeing this beautiful form of Gopāla. For a long time He danced and chanted in ecstatic love.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:250|Cc. Madhya 9.250]]
  : When they first saw Him, the Tattvavādī Vaiṣṇavas considered Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu a Māyāvādī sannyāsī. Therefore they did not talk to Him.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:251|Cc. Madhya 9.251]]
  : Later, after seeing Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu in ecstatic love, they were struck with wonder. Then, considering Him a Vaiṣṇava, they gave Him a nice reception.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:252|Cc. Madhya 9.252]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu could understand that the Tattvavādīs were very proud of their Vaiṣṇavism. He therefore smiled and began to speak to them.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:253|Cc. Madhya 9.253]]
  : Considering them very proud, Caitanya Mahāprabhu began His discussion.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:254|Cc. Madhya 9.254]]
  : The chief ācārya of the Tattvavāda community was very learned in the revealed scriptures. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu humbly questioned him.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:255|Cc. Madhya 9.255]]
  : Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "I do not know very well the aim of life and how to achieve it. Please tell Me of the best ideal for humanity and how to attain it."

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:256|Cc. Madhya 9.256]]
  : The ācārya replied, "When the activities of the four castes and the four āśramas are dedicated to Kṛṣṇa, they constitute the best means whereby one can attain the highest goal of life.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:257|Cc. Madhya 9.257]]
  : "When one dedicates the duties of varṇāśrama-dharma to Kṛṣṇa, he is eligible for five kinds of liberation. Thus he is transferred to the spiritual world in Vaikuṇṭha. This is the highest goal of life and the verdict of all revealed scriptures."

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:258|Cc. Madhya 9.258]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "According to the verdict of the śāstras, the process of hearing and chanting is the best means to attain loving service to Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:259-260|Cc. Madhya 9.259-260]]
  : " 'This process entails hearing, chanting and remembering the holy name, form, pastimes, qualities and entourage of the Lord, offering service according to the time, place and performer, worshiping the Deity, offering prayers, always considering oneself the eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa, making friends with Him and dedicating everything unto Him. These nine items of devotional service, when directly offered to Kṛṣṇa, constitute the highest attainment of life. This is the verdict of the revealed scriptures.'

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:261|Cc. Madhya 9.261]]
  : "When one comes to the platform of loving service to Lord Kṛṣṇa by executing these nine processes beginning with hearing and chanting, he has attained the fifth platform of success and the limit of life's goals.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:262|Cc. Madhya 9.262]]
  : " 'When a person is actually advanced and takes pleasure in chanting the holy name of the Lord, who is very dear to him, he is agitated and loudly chants the holy name. He also laughs, cries, becomes agitated and chants just like a madman, not caring for outsiders.'

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:263|Cc. Madhya 9.263]]
  : "In every revealed scripture there is condemnation of fruitive activities. It is advised everywhere to give up engagement in fruitive activities, for by executing them no one can attain the highest goal of life, love of Godhead.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:264|Cc. Madhya 9.264]]
  : " 'Occupational duties are described in the religious scriptures. If one analyzes them, he can fully understand their qualities and faults and then give them up completely to render service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A person who does so is considered a first-class man.'

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:265|Cc. Madhya 9.265]]
  : " 'Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear.'

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:266|Cc. Madhya 9.266]]
  : " 'As long as one is not satiated by fruitive activity and has not awakened his taste for devotional service by śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ, one has to act according to the regulative principles of the Vedic injunctions.'

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:267|Cc. Madhya 9.267]]
  : "Pure devotees reject the five kinds of liberation; indeed, for them liberation is very insignificant because they see it as hellish.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:268|Cc. Madhya 9.268]]
  : " 'Pure devotees always reject the five kinds of liberation, which include living in the spiritual Vaikuṇṭha planets, possessing the same opulences as those possessed by the Supreme Lord, having the same bodily features as the Lord's, associating with the Lord and merging into the body of the Lord. The pure devotees do not accept these benedictions without the service of the Lord.'

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:269|Cc. Madhya 9.269]]
  : " 'It is very difficult to give up material opulence, land, children, society, friends, riches, wife or the blessings of the goddess of fortune, which are desired even by great demigods. But King Bharata did not desire such things, and this was quite befitting his position, because for a pure devotee whose mind is always engaged in service of the Lord, even the liberation of merging into the existence of the Lord is insignificant. And what to speak of material opportunities?'

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:270|Cc. Madhya 9.270]]
  : " 'A person who is a devotee of Lord Nārāyaṇa is not afraid of a hellish condition because he considers it the same as elevation to the heavenly planets or liberation. The devotees of Lord Nārāyaṇa are accustomed to seeing all these things on the same level.'

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:271|Cc. Madhya 9.271]]
  : "Both liberation and fruitive activity are rejected by devotees. You are trying to establish these things as life's goal and the process for attaining it."

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:272|Cc. Madhya 9.272]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu continued speaking to the Tattvavādī ācārya: "Seeing that I am a mendicant in the renounced order of life, you have been playing with Me in a duplicitous way. You have not actually described the process and ultimate objective."

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:273|Cc. Madhya 9.273]]
  : After hearing Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the ācārya of the Tattvavāda-sampradāya became very much ashamed. Upon observing Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's rigid faith in Vaiṣṇavism, he was struck with wonder.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:274|Cc. Madhya 9.274]]
  : The Tattvavādī ācārya replied, "What You have said is certainly factual. It is the conclusion of all the revealed scriptures of the Vaiṣṇavas.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:275|Cc. Madhya 9.275]]
  : "Still, whatever Madhvācārya has established as the formula for our party, we practice as a party policy."

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:276|Cc. Madhya 9.276]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "Both the fruitive worker and the speculative philosopher are considered nondevotees. We see both elements present in your sampradāya.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:277|Cc. Madhya 9.277]]
  : "The only qualification that I see in your sampradāya is that you accept the form of the Lord as truth."

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:278|Cc. Madhya 9.278]]
  : Thus Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu broke the pride of the Tattvavādīs to pieces. He then went to the holy place known as Phalgu-tīrtha.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:279|Cc. Madhya 9.279]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the son of mother Śacī, went to Tritakūpa, and after seeing the Viśālā Deity there, He went to the holy place known as Pañcāpsarā-tīrtha.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:280|Cc. Madhya 9.280]]
  : After seeing Pañcāpsarā, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu went to Gokarṇa. While there, He visited the temple of Lord Śiva, and then He went to Dvaipāyani. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the crown jewel of all sannyāsīs, then went to Sūrpāraka-tīrtha.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:281|Cc. Madhya 9.281]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then visited the town of Kolāpura, where He saw the goddess of fortune in the temple of Kṣīra-bhagavatī and Lāṅga-gaṇeśa in another temple, known as Cora-pārvatī.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:282|Cc. Madhya 9.282]]
  : From there Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu went to Pāṇḍarapura, where He happily saw the temple of Viṭhṭhala Ṭhākura.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:283|Cc. Madhya 9.283]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu chanted and danced in various ways as usual. A brāhmaṇa, seeing Him in ecstatic love, was very much pleased and invited the Lord to his home for lunch.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:284|Cc. Madhya 9.284]]
  : This brāhmaṇa offered Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu food with great respect and love. After finishing His lunch, the Lord received auspicious news.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:285|Cc. Madhya 9.285]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu received word that Śrī Raṅga Purī, one of the disciples of Śrī Mādhavendra Purī, was present in that village at the home of a brāhmaṇa.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:286|Cc. Madhya 9.286]]
  : Hearing this news, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu immediately went to see Śrī Raṅga Purī at the brāhmaṇa's home. Upon entering, the Lord saw him sitting there.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:287|Cc. Madhya 9.287]]
  : As soon as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu saw the brāhmaṇa, He immediately offered him obeisances in ecstatic love, falling flat to the ground. The symptoms of transcendental transformation were visible-namely, tears, jubilation, trembling and perspiration.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:288|Cc. Madhya 9.288]]
  : Upon seeing Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu in such an ecstatic mood, Śrī Raṅga Purī said, "Your Holiness, please get up.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:289|Cc. Madhya 9.289]]
  : "Your Holiness is certainly related to Śrī Mādhavendra Purī, without whom there is no fragrance of ecstatic love."

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:290|Cc. Madhya 9.290]]
  : After saying this, Śrī Raṅga Purī lifted Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu up and embraced Him. As the two of them embraced shoulder to shoulder, they began to cry in ecstasy.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:291|Cc. Madhya 9.291]]
  : After some moments, they came to their senses and became patient. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then informed Śrī Raṅga Purī about His relationship with Īśvara Purī.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:292|Cc. Madhya 9.292]]
  : They were both inundated by the wonderful ecstasy of love that was aroused in them. Finally they sat down and respectfully began to converse.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:293|Cc. Madhya 9.293]]
  : In this way they discussed topics about Lord Kṛṣṇa continually for five to seven days.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:294|Cc. Madhya 9.294]]
  : Out of curiosity, Śrī Raṅga Purī asked Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu about His birthplace, and the Lord informed him that it was Navadvīpa-dhāma.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:295|Cc. Madhya 9.295]]
  : Śrī Raṅga Purī had formerly gone to Navadvīpa with Śrī Mādhavendra Purī, and he therefore remembered the incidents that took place there.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:296|Cc. Madhya 9.296]]
  : As soon as Śrī Raṅga Purī recalled Navadvīpa, he also recalled accompanying Śrī Mādhavendra Purī to the house of Jagannātha Miśra, where he had taken lunch. He even remembered the taste of an unprecedented curry made of banana flowers.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:297|Cc. Madhya 9.297]]
  : Śrī Raṅga Purī also remembered the wife of Jagannātha Miśra. She was very much devoted and chaste. As for her affection, she was exactly like the mother of the universe.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:298|Cc. Madhya 9.298]]
  : He also remembered how Śrī Jagannātha Miśra's wife, Śacīmātā, was expert in cooking. He recalled that she was very affectionate toward the sannyāsīs and fed them exactly like her own sons.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:299|Cc. Madhya 9.299]]
  : Śrī Raṅga Purī also remembered that one of her deserving sons had accepted the renounced order at a very young age. His name was Śaṅkarāraṇya.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:300|Cc. Madhya 9.300]]
  : Śrī Raṅga Purī informed Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu that the sannyāsī named Śaṅkarāraṇya had attained perfection in that holy place, Pāṇḍarapura.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:301|Cc. Madhya 9.301]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "In My previous āśrama, Śaṅkarāraṇya was My brother and Jagannātha Miśra was My father."

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:302|Cc. Madhya 9.302]]
  : After finishing his talks with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Śrī Raṅga Purī started for Dvārakā-dhāma.

  ; [[books:cc:madhya:9:303|Cc. Madhya 9.303]]
