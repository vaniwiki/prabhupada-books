  : O haughty one, you will have two contemptuous sons born of your condemned womb. Unlucky woman, they will cause constant lamentation to all the three worlds!

  ; [[books:sb:3:14:40?preview=false|SB 3.14.40]]
  : They will kill poor, faultless living entities, torture women and enrage the great souls.

  ; [[books:sb:3:14:41?preview=false|SB 3.14.41]]
  : At that time the Lord of the universe, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the well-wisher of all living entities, will descend and kill them, just as Indra smashes the mountains with his thunderbolts.

  ; [[books:sb:3:14:42?preview=false|SB 3.14.42]]

  ; [[books:sb:3:14:44-45?preview=false|SB 3.14.44-45]]
  : The learned Kaśyapa said: Because of your lamentation, penitence and proper deliberation, and also because of your unflinching faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead and your adoration for Lord Śiva and me, one of the sons [Prahlāda] of your son [Hiraṇyakaśipu] will be an approved devotee of the Lord, and his fame will be broadcast equally with that of the Personality of Godhead.

  ; [[books:sb:3:14:48?preview=false|SB 3.14.48]]
  : That topmost devotee of the Lord will have expanded intelligence and expanded influence and will be the greatest of the great souls. Due to matured devotional service, he will certainly be situated in transcendental ecstasy and will enter the spiritual sky after quitting this material world.

  ; [[books:sb:3:14:49?preview=false|SB 3.14.49]]
  : He will be a virtuously qualified reservoir of all good qualities; he will be jolly and happy in others' happiness, distressed in others' distress, and will have no enemies. He will be a destroyer of the lamentation of all the universes, like the pleasant moon after the summer sun.

  ; [[books:sb:3:14:50?preview=false|SB 3.14.50]]
