The most comprehensive and authoritative Vedic scriptural literature is the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// ("The Beautiful Story of the Personality of Godhead"), the mature contribution of Śrīla Vyāsadeva, the compiler of the //Vedas.// Of the twelve cantos of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// the tenth canto is considered the most confidential, since it describes the transcendental pastimes of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. //Kṛṣṇa// is a summary study of the tenth canto of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.//

The activities of Kṛṣṇa, which appear to be like those of an ordinary human being, can only be properly understood with the help of a bona fide spiritual master fully realized in the knowledge of this transcendental nature. A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda is authorized by an unbreakable disciplic succession of spiritual masters going back thousands of years to the time when Kṛṣṇa appeared. Because he is the representative of the disciplic succession for this age and because of his complete immersion in love of Kṛṣṇa Prabhupāda is uniquely qualified to present Kṛṣṇa as He is.

Śukadeva Gosvāmī, the original speaker of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// has declared that there are three classes of men and that the pastimes of Kṛṣṇa will be relished by each of them. The liberated soul who is no longer interested in mundane topics most certainly hears about Kṛṣṇa with the highest pleasure. The person who is trying to become liberated will also enjoy these topics of the Personality of Godhead, which purify anyone who hears them. And even the grossest materialist will enjoy hearing about Kṛṣṇa because of the resemblance between His  affairs with the //gopīs// and the loving affairs of ordinary   boys and girls.

Foreseeing the publication of this book, with its fifty-eight full color illustrations, Prabhupāda commented, "No other religion has such a full concept of God. I think our Kṛṣṇa book will convince them. Whoever reads it will become a devotee of Kṛṣṇa.
