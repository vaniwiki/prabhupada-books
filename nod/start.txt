//The Nectar of Devotion// is a unique spiritual text that explains the devotional science of bhakti-yoga, or Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Astonishingly intimate in its detailed descriptions of the loving relationships between Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa and His devotees, it is at the same time practical, authoritative and philosophically substantial. It is a summary study of //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu,// which was written in Sanskrit over 400 years ago by the great philosopher-devotee Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī Prabhupāda, and it contains hundreds of quotes from such important Vedic literatures as //Bhagavad-gītā, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// the //Upaniṣads, Mahābhārata// and the //Purāṇas.//

//The Nectar of Devotion// has been called the "lawbook of Kṛṣṇa consciousness," for it is the text which guides the devotees of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement in the details of their daily lives. It elaborately explains the philosophical background behind the many rules and regulations that devotees of Kṛṣṇa voluntarily follow, and it probes deeply into the thoughts and emotions that motivate a Kṛṣṇa conscious devotee.

Most importantly, //The Nectar of Devotion// goes beyond the limitations of both empty religious sentiment and dry, impersonal philosophy. It brings the reader to a factual understanding of the eternal activities of the spiritual world and offers practical step-by-step instructions which can enable the serious student to actually enter into these pastimes, in a personal, face-to-face loving relationship with Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

<blockquote>"O Supreme Lord, I know that young girls have natural affection for young boys and that young boys have natural affection for young girls. I am praying at Your lotus feet that my mind may become attracted unto You in the same spontaneous way."

This book is especially intended to help establish eternal religious principles for the benefit of all human beings. The text is flooded with nectarean stories, philosophy and poetic verses about Kṛṣṇa and His pure devotees---all taken directly from the Vedic literatures. It is a summary study of Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu, which was written in Sanskrit by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, the chief of the six direct disciples of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Lord Caitanya, who appeared in India 500 years ago, is revealed by Vedic scriptures to be an incarnation of God in the role of His own devotee. He and His followers are thus most authorized to teach us how to become perfect in spiritual life.

The subject matter is love of God. The basic principle of life is that we all have a general propensity to love someone. At the present moment, human society teaches one to love his country or family or his personal self, but there is no information where to repose the loving propensity so that everyone can become happy. That missing point is God, or Kṛṣṇa. //The Nectar of Devotion// teaches us how to stimulate our original love for Kṛṣṇa and how to be situated in that position where we can enjoy our blissful life. The presentation of this authoritative information about the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, and our relationship with Him is simply the mercy of His pure devotee, His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda, the spiritual master in disciplic succession from Lord Caitanya who is distributing the science of Kṛṣṇa throughout the world.
